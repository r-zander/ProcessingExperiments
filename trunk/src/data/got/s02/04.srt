1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,043
- Previously on Game of Thrones...
<i>- Does it ever end?</i>

2
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,338
<i>This is further east than I've ever been.</i>

3
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:05,797
Take our remaining horses.

4
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:10,052
Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us,
and what lies on the other side.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,207
May I present my wife
Margaery of House Tyrell?

6
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:15,080
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,809
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself.

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,021
My son is fighting a war,
not playing at one.

9
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:24,858
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

10
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:27,305
You must give yourself to the Lord of Light.

11
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:29,863
I've said the words, damn you.

12
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:32,533
I will give you a son.

13
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:36,045
We've come to a dangerous place.

14
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,829
My sister wants to hurt me.

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,873
She can't know about you.

16
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:41,683
- Who are you?
- I'm Shae, My Lady.

17
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:42,876
Your new handmaiden.

18
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,537
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

19
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,879
<i>You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

20
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,293
<i>I fought for my king.</i> Soon I'll
fight for him on the battlefield.

21
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:53,019
Die for him if I must.

22
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:03,230
You told the Queen about my plans
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
Never!

24
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:05,954
<i>Throw him in one of the black cells.

25
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,904
Myrcella is my only daughter.

26
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,661
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

27
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:11,757
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

28
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:14,541
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

29
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:18,761
Not tonight. There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

30
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,586
I'm sorry. I...

31
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:22,442
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

32
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:25,855
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- There's no need for us to play games.

33
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,508
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

34
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:31,098
My brother Jaime rots
in a northern stockade.

35
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,656
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

36
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:34,902
But his mother might.

37
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,306
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

38
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,206
- Outside!
- Come here, boy!

39
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:42,673
<i>Sweet boy, help us.</i>

40
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,396
<i>Give it to me.

41
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,987
Round up any survivors.

42
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:53,989
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

43
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,143
We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.

44
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:57,627
You want Gendry?

45
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,022
You already got him.

50
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,220
It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest.
He's the strongest.

51
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,294
Bulls are bigger than lions.
Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

52
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:08,911
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.

53
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,672
All right...

54
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:13,458
The Mountain or our man Jaime.

55
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:14,988
If he ever gets out.

56
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:17,528
Loras Tyrell?

57
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,884
Loras Tyrell.

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,888
He's prettier than the queen.

59
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,305
I don't care about pretty.

60
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,102
He's better with a sword than any of them.

61
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,980
How good could he be?

62
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:28,364
He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,

63
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,025
and Renly ain't dead.

64
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,293
The horses seem a little spooked to you?

65
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,389
They're horses.

66
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,022
They get spooked by their own shadows.

67
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,448
Do you hear that?

68
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:54,255
No.

69
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:57,154
There's something out there.

70
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,166
Oh, you're a right little prick.

71
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:28,859
You should see your face.
I swear you pissed yourself.

72
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,963
"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

73
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:35,210
- There is something out there.
- Yeah, don't even try me.

74
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:37,897
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

75
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:40,536
Rennick!

76
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:50,325
<i>- King in the North!
- The King in the North!</i>

77
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:13,343
Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours.

78
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,944
<i>They're dead. Take everything they've got.

79
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:17,586
We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners.

80
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,674
Barely enough food to feed our own.

81
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,739
We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.

82
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,185
Of course, Your Grace.

83
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,547
The officers will be useful.

84
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,250
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I doubt it.

86
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,734
Well, we'll learn soon enough.

87
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,090
In my family we say,

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,049
"A naked man has few secrets.

89
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,822
A flayed man none."

90
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:40,884
My father outlawed flaying in the North.

91
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:42,241
We're not in the North.

92
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,673
We're not torturing them.

93
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,155
The high road's very pretty,

94
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:49,074
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

95
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,170
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.

96
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,840
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

97
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,544
<i>No, no, don't! Don't!
Please!

98
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,656
The rot's set in.

99
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,189
It doesn't even hurt.
No, don't! No, don't!

100
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,456
Please, don't! It'll get better.

101
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:14,058
- It doesn't even hurt.
- The rot will spread.

102
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:17,284
- If we don't take the foot now...
- No, you can't!

103
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:22,559
Ser! Please, Ser.

104
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,808
- I can't lose...
- You'll die if she does it.

105
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,179
I don't want to be a cripple, please.

106
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:29,251
Surely one of our men needs your
attention more than this cub.

107
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,649
Your men are not my men, My Lord.

108
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,223
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

109
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,935
- You can't!
- Bite on it.

110
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,620
It's better than biting
your own tongue, believe me.

111
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,719
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

112
00:08:16,624 --> 00:08:18,265
Your last name?

113
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,721
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

114
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,616
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

115
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:25,347
That boy lost his foot on your orders.

116
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:28,222
They killed my father.

117
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,964
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

118
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,103
Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?

119
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,456
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.

120
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:39,598
He probably never held a spear before they
shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

121
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,607
I have no hatred for the lad.

122
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,697
That should help his foot grow back.

123
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,088
You'd have us surrender,

124
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,667
end all this bloodshed. I understand.

125
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,280
The country would be at peace

126
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,456
and life would be just under the righteous hand
of good King Joffrey.

127
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:01,384
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the Gods give me strength.

128
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:02,736
And then what?

129
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,204
I don't know.

130
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:06,776
We'll go back to Winterfell.

131
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:09,880
I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.

132
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,280
So who will?

133
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,010
I don't know.

134
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:17,451
You're fighting to overthrow a king,
and yet you have no plan for what comes after?

135
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:19,416
First we have to win the war.

136
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,596
You never told me where you're from.

137
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,576
- Volantis.
- Volantis?

138
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,237
You're far from home.

139
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:34,675
The boy was lucky you were here.

140
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:36,771
He was unlucky that you were.

141
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,564
You're here to answer for your
brother's latest treasons.

142
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,594
Your Grace,

143
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,970
whatever my traitor brother
has done, I had no part.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,406
- You know that. I beg you...
- Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.

145
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:59,077
Using some vile sorcery,

146
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:02,521
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

147
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:05,270
Thousands of good men were butchered.

148
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,538
After the slaughter, the northmen feasted on
the flesh of the slain.

149
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:14,178
Killing you would send your
brother a message.

150
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:20,429
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

151
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,629
Stand.

152
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:28,348
So we'll have to send your brother
a message some other way.

153
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:29,849
Meryn.

154
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,690
Leave her face.

155
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,219
I like her pretty.

156
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:47,205
Meryn, My Lady is overdressed.

157
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,219
Unburden her.

158
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,420
If you want Robb Stark to hear us,

159
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,027
we're going to have to speak louder.

160
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,328
What is the meaning of this?

161
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:14,727
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

162
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,903
The kind who serves his king, Imp.

163
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:20,512
Careful, now. We don't want
to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.

164
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:23,023
Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

165
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,437
She is to be your queen.

166
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,286
Have you no regard for her honor?

167
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,512
- I'm punishing her.
- For what crimes?

168
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:31,756
She did not fight her
brother's battle, you half-wit.

169
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,942
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

170
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,273
The Mad King did as he liked.

171
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,562
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

172
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:43,745
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

173
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:47,214
I'm not threatening the King, Ser.
I am educating my nephew.

174
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,773
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

175
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,590
That was a threat.

176
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,319
See the difference?

177
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:20,288
I apologize for my nephew's behavior.

178
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,379
Tell me the truth.

179
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,446
Do you want an end to this engagement?

180
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:27,387
I am loyal to King Joffrey,

181
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:29,066
my one true love.

182
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,459
Lady Stark,

183
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:38,715
you may survive us yet.

184
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,739
The little king's backed up.

185
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,182
Clogged from balls to brains.

186
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,637
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

187
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,211
There's no cure for being a cunt.

188
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,552
But the boy's at that age.

189
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:58,576
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

190
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:01,541
Couldn't hurt to get some
of the poison out.

191
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,795
What are you doing here, dog?

192
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,246
Your uncle left your nameday present

193
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,863
and asked me to see that you got it.

194
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:19,435
And?

195
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,776
What is it?

196
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,902
Look inside, Your Grace.

197
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:32,314
Your Grace.

198
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:35,185
Happy nameday, Your Grace.

199
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,793
My nameday has passed.

200
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:39,280
We won't tell if you won't.

201
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:43,703
No.

202
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:46,474
Her.

203
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,137
Touch her.

204
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,176
Could you hit her?

205
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,917
My uncle sent you?

206
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,907
Yes, Your Grace.

207
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,581
He chose us himself.

208
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,450
Use this.

209
00:14:58,236 --> 00:14:59,600
Harder.

210
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,681
I said...

211
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:08,035
harder.

212
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,753
He'd want me to get his money's worth.

213
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:56,917
Your Grace,

214
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,557
too much pain will spoil the pleasure.

215
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,602
<i>Please, please,</i>

216
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:09,732
please, Your Grace.

217
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,570
Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...

218
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,318
Oh, I want him to find out.

219
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,947
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

220
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,942
and show him what you've done.

221
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,834
Or the same thing will happen to you.

222
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:33,354
Begin.

223
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,570
Harder!

224
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:57,640
Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.

225
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,796
Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

226
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,964
Your Grace.

227
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:11,694
Now you do the Lannisters' bidding,
is that it?

228
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:17,677
Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?

229
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,865
I'm a practical man.

230
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:23,131
Just not a loyal one.

231
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,187
And who would you have me be loyal to?

232
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,079
Your brother's corpse?

233
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,665
I don't like you, Lord Baelish.

234
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:34,909
I don't like your face.

235
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:38,283
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

236
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:41,729
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

237
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,003
So tell me, why are you here?

238
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,984
You can trust Brienne.

239
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,834
Her loyalty comes without charge.

240
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:55,594
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

241
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,960
many who believe Ned Stark erred
by not supporting your claim.

242
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,513
Now I understand.

243
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,075
You know I have the numbers.

244
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:09,912
You know I'm marching on King's Landing.

245
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,511
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

246
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,786
And your head.

247
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:19,205
I would give priority to my head.

248
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,405
I understand that you don't like me, and...

249
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,769
while that saddens me greatly,

250
00:18:24,956 --> 00:18:27,651
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

251
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,005
When you march on King's Landing,

252
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:34,722
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

253
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,565
open gates.

254
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,693
Your Grace.

255
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,816
Lord Baelish.

256
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,818
All of these tents look the same to me.

257
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,436
- Would you be so kind...
- It would be my pleasure.

258
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:08,338
It took me weeks to learn
my way around the camp.

259
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,813
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

260
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:14,517
And the moment I learn which tent is mine,

261
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:17,044
- we're on the move again.
- Your tent?

262
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,651
Not our tent?

263
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,820
The King snores, perhaps?

264
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,240
Or simply prefers solitude?

265
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,770
Pressures of command, no doubt.

266
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,068
Four kings vying for the throne.

267
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,008
I am not tutored in warfare, but...

268
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,191
basic arithmetic favors the side
with the greater numbers.

269
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,143
If war were arithmetic,

270
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:41,239
the mathematicians would rule the world.

271
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,285
But I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent the just now.

272
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,980
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

273
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,692
And on the night of the your wedding,

274
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:52,307
who was by the King's side then?

275
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,450
You seem quite interested in our marriage.

276
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:57,052
Your marriage is quite interesting...

277
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,895
Not only to me, but to the realm.

278
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:04,881
The marriage of a wealthy girl always
breeds interest, if nothing else.

279
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,081
You've never married, have you?

280
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:12,590
I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

281
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,460
That is sad.

282
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,471
Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole
notion of marriage seems to confuse you,

283
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,308
so allow me to explain.

284
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,838
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

285
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:28,434
Here is your tent, Lord Baelish.
Good night.

286
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:03,437
This isn't your horse.

287
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:08,143
It was given to me by the Thirteen.

288
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:11,258
- The Elders of Qarth.
- Quart?

289
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:14,445
Three days to the east, on the sea.

290
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:16,875
Will they let us in?

291
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,988
They said they would be honored
to receive the Mother of Dragons.

292
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:25,904
What do you know of this place?

293
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,687
Only that the desert around their walls
is called the Garden of Bones.

294
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:35,430
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

295
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,143
the garden grows.

296
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:52,351
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

297
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:03,582
What kind of fire melts stone?

298
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:06,936
Dragon fire.

299
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:09,190
There's dragons here?

300
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
No, all the dragons are dead.

301
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:14,128
What's that smell?

302
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:16,819
Dead people.

303
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,452
Move.

304
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,823
<i>Please, please, no, no!</i>

305
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,392
<i>No.</i>

306
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:51,392
He's dead.

307
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,458
He was my son.

308
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:00,250
My sister was three days ago.

309
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,873
My husband, the day before that.

310
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:07,684
They take someone every day?

311
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,580
Does anyone live?

312
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,690
Joffrey.

313
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,218
Cersei.

314
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,250
Ilyn Payne.

315
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:43,047
The Hound.

316
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,022
Joffrey.

317
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:47,422
Cersei.

318
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:49,972
Ilyn Payne.

319
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,064
The Hound.

320
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:53,909
Joffrey.

321
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,391
Cersei.

322
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:57,205
Ilyn Payne.

323
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:58,945
The Hound.

324
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,291
How dare you?

325
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,603
You may have heard false reports.

326
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,830
- You betrayed Ned.
- Betrayed?

327
00:24:08,974 --> 00:24:11,223
I wanted him to serve as
Protector of the Realm. I...

328
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,125
- begged him to seize the moment.
- I trusted you.

329
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:16,019
My husband trusted you.

330
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:20,049
And you repaid our faith with treachery.

331
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,306
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

332
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:22,316
Cat, I've...

333
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,942
I've loved you since I was a boy.

334
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:30,254
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance...

335
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:32,391
Have you lost your mind? Get out!

336
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,419
Do you want to see your girls again?

337
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:54,377
Sansa, more beautiful than ever.

338
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,173
And Arya,

339
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,613
just as wild as ever.

340
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:01,225
You have Arya, too?

341
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,687
Both girls are healthy

342
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:05,932
and safe...

343
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:07,626
for now.

344
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:11,653
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

345
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,089
I fear for their longevity

346
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,234
if they remain in the capital.

347
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,499
What do you want?

348
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,079
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

349
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:46,739
Of course they will.

350
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:49,618
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

351
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:51,756
Robb will never agree to those terms.

352
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,666
I'm not bringing these terms to him.

353
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,670
I'm bringing them to you.

354
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:58,106
You think I'd keep secrets from my son?

355
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:02,740
Robb has surprised them all with his
skills in battle, but he's not a mother.

356
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:04,417
Consider it, Cat.

357
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:08,754
You may not get another chance.

358
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:15,666
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

359
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,481
A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.

360
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:23,033
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

361
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:26,685
- is offered in good faith.
- Good faith?

362
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:33,069
What's this?

363
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,674
Your husband was an honorable man.

364
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:09,865
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

365
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,016
- You may not believe...
- Get out.

366
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,740
<i>Get up, you dogs!</i>

367
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,334
That's him,...

368
00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:05,474
the one who picks.

369
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:07,821
The Mountain.

370
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:12,135
What are you doing?

371
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:14,936
He told me he stares at him every day.

372
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:16,846
That's why he doesn't get picked.

373
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,570
<i>You.</i>

374
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,169
<i>Move, boy!</i>

375
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,109
<i>Move!</i>

376
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,340
Is there gold and silver in the village?

377
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,470
- I don't know.
- Gems?

378
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:15,052
I didn't see any.

379
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:17,140
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

380
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:36,422
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know. Please.

381
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,852
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

382
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:47,664
- Which of the villagers aided them?
- I don't know.

383
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:49,313
- Who?
- I...

384
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:56,340
- Who?
- I never saw.

385
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:59,043
- Who?
- I never saw.

386
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,656
Please. Please, stop.
Please,...

387
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:02,332
- it's starting to...
- Who?

388
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:06,994
I didn't see anyone help him.
Take it off! Take it off!

389
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:10,430
- Who helped him?
- Ganes the butcher and his son.

390
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:12,934
That's better.
You've been very helpful.

391
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:17,046
No, stop, please!
What are you doing? Please, stop!

392
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:21,135
Please, stop! No! No!
I told you everything!

393
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:23,584
No! No!

394
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:27,112
Joffrey.

395
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:29,773
Cersei.

396
00:30:30,783 --> 00:30:31,833
Ilyn Payne.

397
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:35,895
- The Hound.
<i>- Please, Polliver. Some food.</i>

398
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:38,311
Just a crust of bread.

399
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:43,885
Polliver.

400
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,076
The Mountain.

401
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:07,263
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

402
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:11,043
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

403
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:14,446
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

404
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:17,496
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

405
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:20,525
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

406
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,905
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

407
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:27,035
Why is your stag on fire?

408
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:32,295
The King has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

409
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:38,004
You must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

410
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:42,584
Brother, now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

411
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:46,287
- Watch yourself, Renly.
- No, no, I'm relieved.

412
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:48,996
I never really believed you're a fanatic.

413
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:51,026
Charmless, rigid,...

414
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,103
a bore, yes,
but not a godly man.

415
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,632
You should kneel before your brother.

416
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:59,077
He's the Lord's chosen,...

417
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:03,057
- born amidst salt and smoke.
- Born amidst salt and smoke?

418
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,600
- Is he a ham?
- That's twice I've warned you.

419
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,280
Listen to yourselves.

420
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,722
If you were sons of mine,
I would knock

421
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:12,766
your heads together and
lock you in a bedchamber

422
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:15,234
until you remembered that you were brothers.

423
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:18,376
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

424
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:20,735
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

425
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:23,235
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

426
00:32:23,265 --> 00:32:25,825
And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.

427
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:30,572
- We share a common enemy.
- The Iron Throne is mine by right.

428
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:34,267
All those that deny that are my foes.

429
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:38,126
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

430
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,147
Old men deny it with their death rattle and

431
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:42,956
unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs.

432
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:46,814
No one wants you for their King.

433
00:32:47,363 --> 00:32:49,763
You never wanted any friends, brother.

434
00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:52,843
But a man without friends is a man without power.

435
00:32:53,642 --> 00:32:56,461
For the sake of the mother who bore us,

436
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:58,891
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

437
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:01,215
Strike your banners,

438
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,566
come to me before dawn,

439
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:06,505
and I will grant you your old seat in the council.

440
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:10,044
I'll even name you my heir,...

441
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,025
until a son is born to me.

442
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:16,795
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

443
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:23,293
Look across those fields, brother.

444
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,325
Can you see all those banners?

445
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,846
You think a few bolts of cloth will make you King?

446
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:28,878
No.

447
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:33,784
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

448
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:35,064
We shall see, Renly.

449
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,229
Come the dawn, we shall see.

450
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,374
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

451
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:42,805
The night is dark and full of terrors.

452
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:49,895
Would you believe,...

453
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:52,104
I loved him once?

454
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:14,054
I thought we were welcome.

455
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:19,482
If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching
your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.

456
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,566
Horde?

457
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:39,865
My name is Daenerys...

458
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:43,342
Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.

459
00:34:44,024 --> 00:34:47,620
- You know me, My Lord?
- Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

460
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:51,582
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

461
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,552
They call you the Mother of Dragons.

462
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,521
And what should I call you?

463
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:02,009
My name is quite long and quite
impossible for foreigners to pronounce.

464
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,031
I am simply a trader of spices.

465
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:06,914
But we are,...

466
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:08,793
the Thirteen,

467
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:12,244
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

468
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,660
the greatest city that ever was or will be.

469
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:20,560
- The beauty of Quarth is legendary...
- Qarth.

470
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:24,368
Qarth.

471
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,903
Might we see the dragons?

472
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:33,783
My,...

473
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:35,498
friend,

474
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:40,778
we have travelled very far.
We have no food, no water.

475
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,565
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored...

476
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:46,065
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

477
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,955
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

478
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,868
Some of my more skeptical friends
refuse to believe your,...

479
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:57,666
children even exist.

480
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:01,101
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

481
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:05,334
- I am not a liar.
- I don't think you are.

482
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:10,319
But as I've never met you before,
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

483
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:13,599
Where I come from,

484
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:19,652
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

485
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:22,514
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

486
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,793
We wish you well.

487
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:29,801
What are you doing?

488
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:33,244
You promised to receive me.

489
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:36,861
We have received you.
Here we are,...

490
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:38,615
and here you are.

491
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:40,462
If you do not let us in,

492
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:42,545
all of us will die.

493
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,772
Which we shall deeply regret.

494
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,404
But Qarth did not become the greatest
city that ever was or will be

495
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:52,282
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

496
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,450
Khaleesi, please be careful.

497
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,896
Thirteen!

498
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:09,340
When my dragons are grown,

499
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:12,282
we will take back what was stolen from me

500
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,394
and destroy those who have wronged me.
We will,...

501
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,886
lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.

502
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:21,584
Turn us away,...

503
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:24,226
and we will burn you first.

504
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,932
You are a true Targaryen.

505
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:32,101
Only, as you said a moment ago,

506
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:35,264
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

507
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,340
And so...

508
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,101
Retreating in fear from a little girl,

509
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,872
is unbecoming of the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

510
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:46,425
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

511
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:48,427
The Thirteen have spoken.

512
00:37:48,457 --> 00:37:51,192
I am one of the Thirteen

513
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:53,606
and I am still speaking.

514
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:56,121
The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground

515
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,849
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

516
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,483
She is the Mother of Dragons.

517
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:04,869
Do you expect her to watch her people starve

518
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:06,995
without breathing fire?

519
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:10,261
I believe we can allow a few
Dothraki through our gates,

520
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:12,076
without dooming our city.

521
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:13,620
After all,

522
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,174
here I am,

523
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:17,456
a savage from the Summer Isles,

524
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:19,755
and Qarth still stands.

525
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:22,266
Our decision is final.

526
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:23,820
Very well.

527
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:28,955
<i>I invoke Soumai.</i>

528
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:35,960
I will vouch for her, her people,

529
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:39,284
<i>and her dragons in accordance with the law.</i>

530
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,388
Be it on your head.

531
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:51,791
Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.

532
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,537
<i>You.</i>

533
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,545
Is there gold or silver in the village?

534
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:57,638
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

535
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:00,397
I don't know what that is.

536
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,260
<i>You two, take Lord Lannister's
things to his quarters.</i>

537
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:34,823
What's this?

538
00:40:34,853 --> 00:40:37,624
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

539
00:40:38,952 --> 00:40:40,591
Evidently not.

540
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,358
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

541
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:46,842
Cells are overflowing, My Lord.

542
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,995
This lot won't be here long.

543
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:51,077
Don't need no permanent place.

544
00:40:51,107 --> 00:40:53,302
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

545
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,127
Are we so well-manned,...

546
00:40:56,308 --> 00:40:58,597
that we can afford to discard

547
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:01,386
able young bodies and skilled laborers?

548
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:11,682
You,...

549
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,669
do you have a trade?

550
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,224
Smith, My Lord.

551
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:20,370
What are you looking at? Kneel!

552
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:22,760
Kneel,...

553
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,763
or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

554
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:26,928
He'll do no such thing.

555
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:29,315
This one's a girl,...

556
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:30,733
you idiot,...

557
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:33,622
dressed as a boy.
Why?

558
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,345
Safer to travel, My Lord.

559
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,128
Smart.

560
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,882
More than I can say for this lot.

561
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:42,403
Get these prisoners to work.

562
00:41:42,758 --> 00:41:44,349
Bring the girl.

563
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,514
I need a new cupbearer.

564
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:47,573
<i>My Lord.</i>

565
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,503
Your visits are too few, cousin.

566
00:41:57,594 --> 00:42:01,623
Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands
you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.

567
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,107
Here's your warrant.

568
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,645
So it is.

569
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,688
Will you take a cup with me?

570
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:09,761
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

571
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:12,498
I am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you,...

572
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:13,707
Imp.

573
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:16,868
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

574
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,146
I would have thought she'd come herself.

575
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:21,107
Instead she sends you.

576
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,024
- What am I to make of that?
- I don't care what you make of it,...

577
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:26,900
so long as you release your prisoner immediately.

578
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,423
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

579
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:33,091
As I said several times.

580
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:36,179
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

581
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:39,950
When the Queen Regent gives me a
command, I carry it out without delay.

582
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,586
Cersei must have great trust in you,

583
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:48,195
allowing you into her chamber

584
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:50,451
during the hour of the wolf.

585
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:57,121
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

586
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,699
She often works from dusk till dawn.

587
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:01,265
She must be very glad to have you helping her

588
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:03,740
from dusk till dawn.

589
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:09,511
Lavender oil. She always loved
lavender oil, even as a girl.

590
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:11,398
I am a knight!

591
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:13,774
An anointed knight, yes.

592
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:14,746
Tell me,...

593
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:18,860
did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

594
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:21,370
What?

595
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:23,002
Nothing to say?

596
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:24,765
No more warnings for me, Ser?

597
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:28,295
- You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
- Have you ever given any thought

598
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:32,417
to what King Joffrey will have to say when he
finds out you've been bedding his mother?

599
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,884
- It's not my fault!
- Did she take you,...

600
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:41,673
against your will?

601
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,972
- Can you not defend yourself, knight?
- Your own father, Lord Tywin,

602
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:47,012
when I was named the King's squire,

603
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,965
he told me to obey her in everything.

604
00:43:48,995 --> 00:43:50,917
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

605
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:52,222
I only meant...

606
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:54,216
I did as I was bid.

607
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:57,892
Hated every moment of it,
is that what you'll have me believe?

608
00:43:58,075 --> 00:44:00,027
A high place in court, a knighthood,

609
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,325
my sister's legs spreading open for you at night.

610
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:04,688
Yes, it must have been terrible.

611
00:44:04,864 --> 00:44:06,902
Wait here.
His Grace will want to hear this.

612
00:44:06,932 --> 00:44:08,636
Mercy! Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

613
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:10,964
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

614
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:13,489
My Lord, it was your sister's bidding...
The Queen.

615
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,200
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

616
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,810
No, I think not.

617
00:44:17,844 --> 00:44:18,944
My Lord?

618
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,900
You heard me.

619
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:27,461
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

620
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,012
Stay close to her side.

621
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,265
Keep her trust.

622
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:32,709
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

623
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,979
No one ever need know,...

624
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,315
as long as you keep faith with me.

625
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:41,862
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

626
00:44:41,892 --> 00:44:43,039
where she goes,

627
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:44,756
who she sees,

628
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:46,653
what they talk of...
Everything.

629
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,383
And you will tell me.

630
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,005
Yes, My Lord, I will.

631
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:53,835
I swear it, as you command.

632
00:44:56,787 --> 00:44:58,984
Rise, rise.

633
00:44:59,752 --> 00:45:02,007
Let us drink to our understanding.

634
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,860
You don't have a cup.
Oh, well.

635
00:45:05,655 --> 00:45:08,601
Smile, cousin.
My sister is a beautiful woman.

636
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:10,096
And it's all for the good of the realm.

637
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:11,329
Go back and tell her,

638
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,125
that I beg her forgiveness, that,...

639
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:15,589
I want no more conflict between us and that

640
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,283
henceforth I shall do
nothing without her consent.

641
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:19,913
But her demands.

642
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,604
I'll give her Pycelle.

643
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:25,002
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

644
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:28,912
Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants,
but I will not have him on the council.

645
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:31,993
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head, but,...

646
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,979
that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

647
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:48,884
<i>Stay within one table length.</i>

648
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:55,225
Your Grace.

649
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:03,123
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

650
00:46:06,321 --> 00:46:09,571
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

651
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,727
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

652
00:46:11,757 --> 00:46:12,757
Fewer.

653
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:14,175
Pardon?

654
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:17,338
<i>Four fewer fingernails to clean.</i>

655
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:20,649
Never understood why you had to wear them.

656
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,872
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

657
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:26,502
It reminds me of your justice.

658
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:29,383
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

659
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:31,609
You were a hero and a smuggler.

660
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,900
A good act does not wash out the bad,

661
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:38,219
nor a bad the good.

662
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,587
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

663
00:46:41,617 --> 00:46:42,617
Does he listen?

664
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:44,697
To me?
Gods, no.

665
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:48,875
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest...

666
00:46:48,905 --> 00:46:49,957
She has a name.

667
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,781
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

668
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:00,960
I've lived within the law for 17...

669
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,925
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

670
00:47:04,263 --> 00:47:06,396
Any shore, any night.

671
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:07,807
What am I bringing ashore?

672
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:09,182
The red woman.

673
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,023
No one must know what you do

674
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:17,151
- and we'll not speak of this again.
- I am true to Your Grace,...

675
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:18,464
and always will be,

676
00:47:19,265 --> 00:47:21,889
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

677
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,028
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

678
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,019
Are you afraid, onion knight?

679
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:02,966
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

680
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:07,294
You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time.

681
00:48:11,425 --> 00:48:13,910
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

682
00:48:14,452 --> 00:48:16,909
I'd say my parts are mixed, My Lady,...

683
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,169
Good and bad.

684
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:22,230
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

685
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,575
A man is good or he is evil.

686
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:27,329
- And which are you?
- Good.

687
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:30,234
I'm a knight myself of sorts,

688
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:32,742
a champion of light and life.

689
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:36,032
Well, that must be very nice for you.

690
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:54,430
Do you love your wife?

691
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:56,686
I do.

692
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,828
Yet you have known other women.

693
00:48:59,422 --> 00:49:01,008
Don't talk about my wife.

694
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,250
I'm not.

695
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,998
I'm talking about other women.

696
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:07,058
Like me, Ser Davos.

697
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:13,005
You want me.

698
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:16,514
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

699
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:20,054
And you will.

700
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:26,637
Strange that this,...

701
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,081
Lord of Light,...

702
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:30,203
asks you to work in the shadows.

703
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:34,039
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

704
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:36,138
They are servants of light,

705
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:38,557
the children of fire.

706
00:49:39,502 --> 00:49:42,850
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

707
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,101
These weren't here before.

708
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:45,849
They've barred the passage.

709
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:48,943
They can't bar our passage.

710
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,427
Gods protect us.

711
00:49:56,382 --> 00:49:58,606
There's only one God, Ser Davos,

712
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:02,663
and he only protects those who serve him.

713
