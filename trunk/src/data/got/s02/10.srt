1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:02,336
<i>The Fist of the First Men.</i>

2
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:04,889
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here.

3
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,919
They came here to get
away from something.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,461
And I don't think it worked.

5
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:09,839
Your sword.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,229
<i>The Kingslayer,</i>
<i>he escaped in the night.</i>

7
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:13,347
How?

8
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,604
Jaime Lannister has
played you for a fool.

9
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,135
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

10
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,936
<i>Returning him may buy</i>
<i>life for my children.</i>

11
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,683
- A girl owes one more name.
- Give a man a name.

12
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:26,534
- Jaqen H'ghar.
- A girl gives a man his own name?

13
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:29,183
I'll un-name you if you help
me and my friends escape.

14
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:32,570
<i>A girl and her friends will</i>
<i>walk through the gate at midnight.</i>

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,502
<i>Who was that out there</i>
<i>hung up at the gates?</i>

16
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:37,435
<i>Must have been
the farmer's boys.

17
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:38,946
<i>Killed them, burned them,</i>

18
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:41,097
<i>and passed them off</i>
<i>as the little lords?</i>

19
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,513
Got as far as the farm
then doubled back.

20
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:46,403
Hoped this would be the last
place they'd think to look.

21
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:48,982
My bastard is only a few
days from Winterfell.

22
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:51,165
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

23
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,193
- If we storm the castle--
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

24
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:56,677
There is only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

25
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:58,197
Send word to your son.

26
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:00,327
Any Ironborn
who surrender will be allowed

27
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:01,902
to return safely
to their homes.

28
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:04,549
With the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

29
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,796
I expect his countrymen will turn on
him the minute they hear the offer.

30
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,655
Mance is gonna march
on the wall.

31
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,546
When he does,
one brother inside his army

32
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,448
will be worth 1,000
fighting against him.

33
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,553
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

34
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:17,553
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

35
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:21,569
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard!

36
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,950
He's not yours
to kill, crow.

37
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,904
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

38
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,076
I don't want you
to marry her.

39
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:32,139
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

40
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,624
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

41
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:35,748
then take me there.

42
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:37,290
That's what
the warlock wants.

43
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,476
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

44
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,861
They're coming ashore.
There are too many.

45
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:44,390
Rain fire on them.

46
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,133
The battle is over.
We have won.

Pod!

53
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,298
Find Bronn or Varys.

54
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:35,925
<i>Tell them I am here</i>
<i>with Maester Pycelle.</i>

55
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,281
Tell them I am
very much alive.

56
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:40,932
Yes, My Lord.

57
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:45,947
Would you like
something for the pain?

58
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:48,839
What happened?

59
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,771
The murderer and traitor
Stannis Baratheon

60
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,157
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

61
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,122
Where am I?

62
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,238
These are your new chambers.

63
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,854
A little cramped, perhaps, but...

64
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:08,884
you don't need much room, do you?

65
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:12,565
<i>You are no longer</i>
<i>Hand of the King.</i>

66
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,721
For your trouble.

67
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:50,225
<i>I, Joffrey of the House</i>
<i>Baratheon, first of my name,</i>

68
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:52,680
the rightful King
of the Andals

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,580
and the First Men,

70
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,533
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

71
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,242
and protector of the Realm,

72
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:00,587
<i>do hereby proclaim</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>

73
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:04,280
<i>Tywin Lannister</i>
<i>the savior of the city</i>

74
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,892
and the Hand of the King.

75
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,973
Thank you, Your Grace.

76
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:33,586
Lord Petyr Baelish,
step forward.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,056
For your good service and

78
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:40,894
ingenuity in uniting the Houses
of Lannister and Tyrell,

79
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,897
<i>I declare that you shall be granted</i>
<i>the castle of Harrenhal...</i>

80
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:46,633
<i>with all its attendant</i>
<i>lands and incomes</i>

81
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,591
<i>to be held by your sons</i>
<i>and grandsons</i>

82
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,163
from this day until
the end of time.

83
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,540
You honor me
beyond words, Your Grace.

84
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:59,946
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

85
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,952
Ser Loras Tyrell.

86
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,375
Your House has come
to our aid.

87
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:16,404
The whole realm is in your debt,
none more so than I.

88
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:19,825
If your family would ask
anything of me, ask it

89
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,994
and it shall be yours.

90
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:23,362
Your Grace,

91
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:25,936
my sister Margaery,

92
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:28,812
her husband was taken
from us before...

93
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,084
She remains innocent.

94
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,690
I would ask you to find it in your heart
to do us the great honor

95
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,894
of joining our Houses.

96
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:42,327
Is this what you want,
Lady Margaery?

97
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:47,121
With all my heart,
Your Grace.

98
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:50,271
I have come to love
you from afar.

99
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:53,083
Tales of your courage and wisdom

100
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,600
<i>have never been</i>
<i>far from my ears.</i>

101
00:07:55,766 --> 00:08:00,259
And those tales have taken
root deep inside of me.

102
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,424
I too have heard tales
of your beauty and grace, but...

103
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:13,053
the tales do not do you justice, My Lady.

104
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:16,653
<i>It would be an honor</i>
<i>to return your love,</i>

105
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,954
but I am promised
to another.

106
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:22,636
A King must keep
his word.

107
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:26,514
Your Grace, in the judgment
of your small council,

108
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,816
it would be neither
proper nor wise

109
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:32,389
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

110
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:37,615
a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
against the throne as we speak.

111
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:39,580
For the good of the realm,

112
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,187
your councilors beg you...

113
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:47,450
to set Sansa Stark aside.

114
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,707
<i>- Margaery!
- We want Margaery!

115
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,793
<i>I would like to heed</i>
<i>your wishes and</i>

116
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,269
<i>the wishes of my people, but...</i>

117
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,771
I took a holy vow.

118
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,550
<i>Your Grace,</i>

119
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:08,865
the Gods do indeed
hold betrothal solemn, but...

120
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:13,274
your father, blessed be his memory,

121
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:16,032
made this pact
before the Starks

122
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:19,988
revealed their falseness.

123
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:22,921
<i>I have consulted</i>
<i>with the High Septon</i>

124
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:27,352
and he assures me that their
crimes against the realm

125
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,382
<i>free you from any promise</i>
<i>you have made to them</i>

126
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,470
<i>in the sight of the Gods.</i>

127
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,037
The Gods are good.

128
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,576
I am free o heed my heart.

129
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:44,954
<i>Ser Loras, I will gladly</i>
<i>wed your sweet sister.</i>

130
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,322
<i>You will be my Queen</i>

131
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:50,551
and I will love you
from this day

132
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:52,653
until my last day.

133
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:16,418
My Lady.

134
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:20,162
<i>My sincerest condolences.</i>

135
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,203
They're right--
I'm not good enough for him.

136
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,154
You shouldn't say that.

137
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:27,656
You'll be good enough
for many things.

138
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,924
He'll still enjoy
beating you.

139
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:32,516
And now that
you're a woman,

140
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:35,939
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

141
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,187
But...

142
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:41,706
- if he's not marrying me--
- He'll let you go home?

143
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:46,307
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

144
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,891
You have a tender heart,

145
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,052
just like your mother
did at your age.

146
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,347
I can see so much
of her in you.

147
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:57,713
She was like a sister to me.

148
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,624
For her sake,

149
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:04,193
I'll help get you home.

150
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,730
King's Landing
is my home now.

151
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,875
Look around you.

152
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,307
We're all liars here.

153
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,640
And every one of us
is better than you.

154
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,262
Come in.

155
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,889
Make yourself
comfortable.

156
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,994
That doesn't look
very comfortable.

157
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:48,099
Here, watch me.

158
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:53,652
No need for that,
my dear.

159
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:55,161
You sure?

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,960
Most men like
what they see.

161
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,111
I'm not like most men.

162
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,966
<i>That's what most men say.</i>

163
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,920
If you don't want
what most men want,

164
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,341
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

165
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,587
I would like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish

166
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,329
has been all you'd
hoped it would be.

167
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:17,893
Have we met?

168
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:20,684
You wouldn't
remember me if we had?

169
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:22,281
I meet a lot of men.

170
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,972
And I think you
remember all of them.

171
00:12:25,256 --> 00:12:28,609
I think your true talents
are wasted on them.

172
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:31,412
You're very kind,
My Lord.

173
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,880
Allow me to return
the favor.

174
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,999
You're afraid.

175
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:46,071
Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.

176
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:47,830
I know who you are.

177
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,231
And, unlike your
current employer,

178
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,967
I protect those
who work for me.

179
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,932
I don't abuse them
to satisfy royal whims

180
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,852
or force them
to abuse each other.

181
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,029
How do you know
about that?

182
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:05,287
I thought you said
you knew who I was.

183
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:09,664
What can I do for you,
Lord Varys?

184
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,381
Littlefinger looks at you

185
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:26,552
and sees a collection
of profitable holes.

186
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:29,436
I see a potential partner.

187
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:34,404
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

188
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,578
He's a dangerous man.

189
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:40,881
But everyone has
their weaknesses.

190
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,816
Your current employer
hides his very well,

191
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,555
but not as well as he thinks.

192
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,863
You're a virgin,
I take it?

193
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,296
Walk.

194
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:00,102
Childhood must have
been awful for you.

195
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:03,339
Were you a foot taller
than all the boys?

196
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:05,992
They laughed at you,
called you names?

197
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,645
Some boys like a challenge.

198
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,847
One or two must have
tried to get inside big Brienne.

199
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,540
- One or two tried.
- Ah.

200
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:17,005
But you fought them off.

201
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:20,195
But maybe you wished one
of them could overpower you,

202
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,960
fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

203
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,082
But none of them
were strong enough.

204
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:27,428
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

205
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:28,698
Of course you are.

206
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:32,643
You'd love to know what it
feels like to be a woman.

207
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,997
<i>"They lay with lions."</i>

208
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:39,941
Tavern girls, I'd say.

209
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:42,776
Probably served
my father's soldiers.

210
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,110
Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.

211
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,369
That's how they earned this.

212
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:52,740
The glorious work of the
northern freedom fighters.

213
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,749
Must make you proud
to serve the Starks.

214
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:58,821
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

215
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,807
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

216
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:08,738
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

217
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:12,345
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

218
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,192
I think these women
would understand if--

219
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,015
I don't care what you think.

220
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,839
<i>I didn't leave it here.</i>

221
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,552
Untie me now.

222
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,351
<i>I gave it to you to cut</i>
<i>the rope, and now I don't</i>

223
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:22,556
<i>have me dagger no more. So...</i>

224
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,032
unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt,

225
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:28,259
it stands to reason
that it's gone-- whoa!

226
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:31,602
What's your business here?

227
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,396
Traveling a prisoner.

228
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,450
You're a woman.
A woman!

229
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,491
<i>Well, fuck me!</i>

230
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,009
If you've quite
finished up--

231
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,250
All right,
we'll be going.

232
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,854
Who do you fight for?

233
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:54,820
The Starks.

234
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,096
What did he do?

235
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:02,072
- Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew? - No...

236
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:04,430
- stealing is a crime.
- But it's not a crime to starve.

237
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,064
That's justice for you.

238
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,150
- <i>Where are you taking him?</i>
- To Riverrun.

239
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,551
Why Riverrun?

240
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,602
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

241
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:15,338
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

242
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,164
I don't give the orders.

243
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,728
He must be important
to someone.

244
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:22,345
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

245
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:25,916
All right,
have it your way,

246
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,459
m'lady.

247
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,573
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

248
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,211
- <i>No.</i>
- Then you don't know me.

249
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,253
Do you ever go to the river
market at Salt Rock?

250
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:41,914
- Is it near Ashemark?
- <i>No.</i>

251
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,890
I've never been there.

252
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:46,692
What do you think
of these beauties?

253
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,024
I hope you gave them
quick deaths.

254
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,305
Two of them we did, yeah.

255
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:55,693
Wait.

256
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:00,880
I do know you.

257
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:03,490
That's Jaime Lannister.

258
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,245
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

259
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:08,704
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

260
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:10,789
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

261
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,968
I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.

262
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:15,717
<i>They dragged him out of the woods</i>
<i>and threw him down before the King.</i>

263
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:18,280
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

264
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,542
If he was, I'd only
be traveling his head.

265
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,711
I have a question
for you both.

266
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:25,113
And I want you to answer it
at the same time.

267
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,749
<i>I count to three,</i>
<i>you both answer.</i>

268
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,832
What's his name?

269
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:31,385
One.

270
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,588
<i>Two.</i>

271
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,554
<i>Three.

272
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,273
Two quick deaths.

273
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:21,653
Those were Stark men.

274
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,384
I don't serve the Starks.

275
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:27,034
I serve Lady Catelyn.

276
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,314
I told her I'd take you
to King's Landing,

277
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,775
and that's what I'm going to do.

278
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:34,868
Stay.

279
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:56,198
Walder Frey is a dangerous
man to cross.

280
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,806
I know that.

281
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,542
And you mean to do it anyway?

282
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,138
I love her.

283
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:08,233
I know that seems
important to you.

284
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,517
It is important to me.

285
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,296
Your father didn't love
me when we married.

286
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,025
He hardly knew me
or I him.

287
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,760
Love didn't just happen to us.

288
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,519
We built it slowly
over the years,

289
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,267
stone by stone,

290
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,793
for you, for your brothers
and sisters, for all of us.

291
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,979
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

292
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,367
but it is stronger.

293
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,114
It lasts longer.

294
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:45,988
And that is what
would be in store for me

295
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,855
with one of
Walder Frey's daughters,

296
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,827
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

297
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,395
Because she's not beautiful?

298
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:54,067
Because she's not exotic
and exciting?

299
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:57,336
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

300
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,780
And you agreed to it.

301
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:03,059
You gave him your word.

302
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,958
Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

303
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:11,551
- If your father lived his life for one thing--
- My father is dead.

304
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:13,492
And the only parent
I have left has no right

305
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,542
to call anyone reckless.

306
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,475
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

307
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:39,735
<i>I did.</i>

308
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:43,213
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

309
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:46,445
And I'm no better
than a savage

310
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,453
trusting in a Fire God.

311
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:54,326
I fought for your God
in Blackwater Bay.

312
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,860
I led my men to the gates
of the Seventh Hell

313
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:01,558
as their brothers burned
alive, and for what?

314
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:04,835
Attacked from behind by
Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

315
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:06,899
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

316
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,864
The Lord of Light
only allows me glimpses.

317
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:11,090
You claimed to speak
for a God.

318
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,447
Will you quit the war just
because you've lost a battle?

319
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,776
You talk about war
as if you understand it.

320
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,918
<i>I've been fighting</i>
<i>far longer than you.</i>

321
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:19,189
Have you?

322
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:21,958
Show me how you fight.

323
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,895
Show me.

324
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,098
Where's your God now?

325
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,907
Will he save you?

326
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:41,537
Where is your God?

327
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:45,261
Inside you.

328
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,452
I murdered my brother.

329
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:07,546
We murdered him.

330
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:12,592
- Share the weight with me.
- He wasn't your brother.

331
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,111
This war
has just begun.

332
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:21,663
It will last for years.

333
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:25,182
Thousands will die
at your command.

334
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,571
You will betray
the men serving you.

335
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:32,492
You will betray your family.

336
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:37,042
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

337
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:40,214
And it will all
be worth it

338
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,559
because you are the Son of Fire.

339
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:47,137
You are the Warrior of Light.

340
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:52,875
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

341
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,961
You will be King.

342
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:02,241
You promise
these things, but...

343
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:05,387
you don't know.

344
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:08,341
None of us know.

345
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:10,660
Let me show you.

346
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,737
Look into the fire,
my King.

347
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,531
Look.

348
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:28,008
- I see fire.
- Keep looking.

349
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:38,031
Do you see?

350
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:41,222
Do you see, my King?

351
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,233
Yes.

352
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:14,584
I will kill that man.

353
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:18,103
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

354
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,309
how many spears
they run through me,

355
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:24,081
I will kill that horn-blowing
cunt before I fall.

356
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:26,769
They want you to know
you're surrounded.

357
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,696
I know I'm surrounded.

358
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:31,234
I know that because I stood
on the battlements

359
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:33,543
and saw I was surrounded.

360
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,198
<i>They don't want</i>
<i>you to sleep.</i>

361
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:36,826
They want to sap
your spirit before--

362
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:40,182
Thank you, wise bald man.

363
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,985
Thank you for explaining
siege tactics to me.

364
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,959
No word from my father?

365
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,464
No.

366
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,730
Send more ravens.

367
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,631
You killed all the ravens.

368
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:05,275
The first time
I saw Winterfell...

369
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:13,460
The first time
I saw Winterfell,

370
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:18,442
it looked like something that had
been here for thousands of years

371
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:23,341
and would be here for thousands
of years after I was dead.

372
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:27,028
I saw it and I thought,

373
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,070
"Of course Ned Stark
crushed our rebellion

374
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,447
and killed my brothers.

375
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:35,303
We never stood a chance against
a man who lives here."

376
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:38,241
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

377
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:40,617
Yes, my captors were
so very kind to me.

378
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:43,346
You love
reminding me of that.

379
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,783
Everyone in this
frozen pile of shit

380
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:49,687
has always loved
reminding me of that.

381
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:54,267
You know what it's like
to be told how lucky you are

382
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,595
to be someone's prisoner?

383
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:01,400
To be told how much
you owe them?

384
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:07,038
And then to go back home
to your real father...

385
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:12,332
I will kill that man.

386
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,854
I swear it to
the Drowned God,

387
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,470
the Old Gods,
the New Gods,

388
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,958
to every fucking God
in every fucking heaven,

389
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,393
I will kill that man.

390
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,250
Theon, listen to me.

391
00:26:22,684 --> 00:26:24,857
I serve Winterfell.

392
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:27,354
Now Winterfell is yours.

393
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,263
I'm bound by oath
to serve you.

394
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:33,233
And what's your counsel,
trusted friend?

395
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:34,672
Run.

396
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:38,006
500 northmen wait
outside the walls.

397
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:39,973
You have 20 men.

398
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,908
You can't win.

399
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:43,899
Wait for nightfall
and run.

400
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,702
There's nowhere to run.

401
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:48,298
I'd never make it back
to the Iron Islands.

402
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:51,164
And even if I did,
even if by some miracle

403
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:54,219
I slipped through the lines
and made it home,

404
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,192
I'd be a coward.

405
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:59,325
The Greyjoy who ran.

406
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,195
The shame of the family.

407
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,632
Don't go home.

408
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,502
<i>Join the Night's Watch.</i>

409
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:14,606
Once a man
has taken the Black...

410
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:19,155
he's beyond reach
of the law.

411
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:22,814
All his past crimes
are forgiven.

412
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,571
I won't make it
to the Wall.

413
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:29,915
I won't make it 10 feet
past the Winterfell gates.

414
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,707
There are ways.

415
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:36,928
Hidden passageways built so the
Lords of Winterfell could escape.

416
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:40,398
The road will be dangerous.

417
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:44,603
But with a little luck...

418
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:52,575
The Night's Watch is an ancient,
honorable order.

419
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:56,332
You'll have
opportunities there.

420
00:27:57,223 --> 00:28:01,687
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

421
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:05,758
The opportunity to make
amends for what you've done.

422
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:10,263
I've done a lot,
haven't I?

423
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:14,166
Things I never
imagined myself doing.

424
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:20,472
I've known you many years,
Theon Greyjoy.

425
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:26,212
You're not the man
you're pretending to be.

426
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:29,222
Not yet.

427
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:35,303
You may be right.

428
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:41,895
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

429
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,423
You hear that?

430
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:56,580
That's the mating call
of the northmen.

431
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:59,349
They want to fuck us.

432
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,977
Well, I haven't had
a good fuck in weeks.

433
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:04,421
I'm ready for one.

434
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,169
They say every Ironborn man is
worth a dozen from the mainland.

435
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,559
<i>Aye!

436
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:13,219
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

437
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:17,541
We die today, brothers.

438
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,929
We die bleeding
from 100 wounds

439
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:25,458
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

440
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,893
but our war cries will echo
through eternity.

441
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:32,771
They will sing about
the battle of Winterfell

442
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,890
until the Iron Islands have
slipped beneath the waves.

443
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,712
Every man, woman, and child
will know who we were

444
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:42,416
and how long we stood.

445
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:44,400
Aggar and Gelmarr;

446
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,800
Wex and Urzen;

447
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,940
Stygg and Black Lorren--

448
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,362
Ironborn warriors
will cry out our names

449
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:54,900
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

450
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,931
Aye!

451
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:58,614
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

452
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,622
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

453
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:02,708
Aye!

454
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,161
And whoever kills
that fucking horn-blower

455
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,147
will stand in bronze
above the shores of Pyke!

456
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:09,440
Aye!

457
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,014
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

458
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:20,211
Thought he'd never shut up.

459
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:22,383
It was a good speech.

460
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,251
Didn't want to interrupt.

461
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:28,814
What is this?

462
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,065
What are you doing?

463
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,494
Let's go home.

464
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,664
<i>Come on.</i>

465
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:55,107
<i>- Why should I believe you?
- Why would I lie about it?</i>

466
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:57,431
To create strife between
my sister and me.

467
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:00,864
Where before there was
nothing but love.

468
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:05,334
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

469
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:10,101
If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
you'd be a dead man.

470
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,993
- <i>Pod.</i>
- Yes, My Lord?

471
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,623
Would it be excessive of me

472
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:20,205
to ask you to save
my life twice in a week?

473
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,952
No, My Lord.

474
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,038
<i>You're a good lad.</i>

475
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:26,937
Get Bronn, tell him I want
four of his most loyal

476
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:29,153
Gold Cloaks outside
my door at all times.

477
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:31,020
I'm afraid your friend
has been relieved

478
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,496
of his command
of the City Watch.

479
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,364
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly
in the hands of your father

480
00:31:37,384 --> 00:31:39,221
or your sister.

481
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:42,208
It varies
from cloak to cloak.

482
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:45,615
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

483
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:48,841
Your father paid them
quite handsomely.

484
00:31:51,469 --> 00:31:54,207
I'm afraid we won't
be seeing each other

485
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:56,756
for some time, My Lord.

486
00:31:57,093 --> 00:32:00,688
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

487
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,370
And I thought
we were friends.

488
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,869
We are.

489
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:08,534
Podrick, would you mind?

490
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,247
There are many who know
that without you

491
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:29,425
this city faced certain defeat.

492
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>The King won't give</i>
<i>you any honors,</i>

493
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,322
<i>the histories</i>
<i>won't mention you,</i>

494
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:38,063
but we will not forget.

495
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,391
Come along now, Podrick.

496
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,196
My love.

497
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:50,553
It was good of you
to come.

498
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:51,845
Good of me?

499
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:54,015
Of course I come.

500
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:01,042
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

501
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:03,637
Have you looked?

502
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,626
I will be the first.

503
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,658
Well?

504
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:35,358
You are a mess.

505
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,762
I'm a monster
as well as a dwarf.

506
00:33:39,796 --> 00:33:42,943
- You should charge me double.
- You think I'm here for money?

507
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:45,201
That was the arrangement
we made.

508
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:48,103
I pay you and you lie to me.

509
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:50,369
I'm a poor little rich man

510
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:52,647
and nobody loves me,
so I make jokes all the time

511
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,226
and pay them to laugh.

512
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,136
Fuck your money.

513
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:58,613
Let's leave.

514
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:00,542
- Leave?
- Leave King's Landing.

515
00:34:00,562 --> 00:34:03,072
They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

516
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,320
Going into wars,
fighting soldiers--

517
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,090
you're terrible at this.

518
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:11,064
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

519
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,758
You don't belong here.

520
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:14,539
What would we do
in Pentos?

521
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,690
Eat,

522
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:17,145
drink,

523
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:19,361
fuck, live.

524
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,775
I want to go with you.

525
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,350
So do it.

526
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,567
Your father, your sister,
all these bad people,

527
00:34:29,587 --> 00:34:31,498
they can't stop you.

528
00:34:31,618 --> 00:34:34,219
Forget about them.
Come with me.

529
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,423
I can't.

530
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,292
I do belong here.

531
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:44,055
These bad people

532
00:34:44,174 --> 00:34:45,822
are what I'm good at.

533
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:48,352
Outtalking them,
outthinking them.

534
00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:49,873
It's what I am.

535
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,782
And I like it.

536
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:58,577
I like it more than
anything I've ever done.

537
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,518
Are you going to leave?

538
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,626
You have a shit memory.

539
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:18,697
I am yours
and you are mine.

540
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:33,098
In the sight
of the Seven,

541
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:37,072
I hereby seal
these two souls,

542
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:42,421
binding them as one
for eternity.

543
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:50,595
Look upon one another
and say the words.

544
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,083
Father, smith,

545
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,234
warrior, mother,

546
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:01,805
maiden, crone,
stranger...

547
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,461
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

548
00:36:04,481 --> 00:36:08,078
from this day
until the end of my days.

549
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:36,499
_

550
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:54,168
_

551
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,134
_

552
00:36:56,242 --> 00:37:00,282
_

553
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:03,052
_

554
00:37:16,322 --> 00:37:18,886
Is this a riddle?

555
00:37:58,384 --> 00:38:00,556
Khaleesi!

556
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:03,499
Khaleesi!

557
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,997
<i>Khaleesi!</i>

558
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:14,907
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

559
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:16,482
You want me?

560
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:20,267
Here I am.
Are you afraid of a little girl?

561
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:46,505
<i>How did he find us?</i>

562
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:12,384
What are you doing here?

563
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,056
Waiting for you.

564
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,829
How did you know
we'd come this way?

565
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:20,622
After all the things you have seen,
this is your question?

566
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:23,336
How did you
kill those guards?

567
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:25,013
Was it hard?

568
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:28,553
No harder than taking a new name
if you know the way.

569
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:30,128
Show me how.

570
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,213
I want to be able to do it, too.

571
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,621
If you would learn,
you must come with me.

572
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,819
Where?

573
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:39,459
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

574
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:42,064
My dancing master
was from Braavos.

575
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:45,155
To be a dancing master
is a special thing, but...

576
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,229
to be a faceless man--

577
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,900
that is something
else entirely.

578
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,376
A girl has many names
on her lips--

579
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:55,135
Joffrey, Cersei,
Tywin Lannister,

580
00:39:55,265 --> 00:39:57,453
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

581
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:00,559
Names to offer up
to the Red God.

582
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:05,151
She could offer them all
one by one.

583
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,785
I want to.

584
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,520
But I can't.

585
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,496
I need to find
my brother and mother.

586
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,132
And my sister.

587
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:23,802
I need to find
her, too.

588
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,692
Then we must part.

589
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:29,199
A man has duties as well.

590
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:30,752
Here.

591
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:32,305
What is it?

592
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:35,411
A coin of great value.

593
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,076
Could it buy a horse?

594
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,269
It is not meant
for the buying of horses.

595
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:42,989
Then what good is it?

596
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:45,646
If the day comes when
you must find me again,

597
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,445
just give that coin
to any man from Braavos

598
00:40:47,465 --> 00:40:49,193
and say these words to him,

599
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,398
"Valar Morghulis."

600
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:53,928
Valar Morghulis.

601
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,747
Please don't go, Jaqen.

602
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:05,235
Jaqen is dead.

603
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:08,460
Say it again.
Valar Morghulis.

604
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,567
Valar Morghulis.

605
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,249
Good.

606
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,183
Farewell, Arya Stark.

607
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,303
Osha,

608
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,823
what are you doing?

609
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:16,163
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

610
00:43:16,183 --> 00:43:19,413
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

611
00:43:22,354 --> 00:43:25,904
They burned it down.
They burned everything.

612
00:43:25,924 --> 00:43:29,021
Not everything.
Not you.

613
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:34,595
But they may come back.
You have to go.

614
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:36,255
Put on your
warmest clothes.

615
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,666
Pack as much food as you
can carry and go north.

616
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:40,577
North's the wrong way.

617
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:42,645
Their mother and brother
are south.

618
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:44,502
We don't know where.

619
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:47,401
There are too many enemies
in the South.

620
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:49,644
Go to the Wall
to Jon.

621
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:52,429
<i>He'll look after you and let your</i>
<i>mother know you're safe.</i>

622
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,286
I don't want to leave you.

623
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:58,287
No more than I want
to leave you.

624
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:01,455
I pulled you
into the world.

625
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:03,592
Both of you.

626
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,716
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

627
00:44:06,846 --> 00:44:11,711
And for that, I consider
myself very, very lucky.

628
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,105
Go now with Hodor.

629
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,722
<i>Go on.</i>

630
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,405
I'll be right here.

631
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,923
Hodor.

632
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:27,552
Osha.

633
00:44:28,616 --> 00:44:30,582
You must protect them.

634
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,589
You're the only one
who can.

635
00:44:35,546 --> 00:44:38,869
You may have to protect
them against your own kind.

636
00:44:38,978 --> 00:44:41,897
I've got no great love
for my own kind.

637
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:47,125
I'll get you milk
of the poppy.

638
00:44:47,244 --> 00:44:48,450
Tell me where to find it.

639
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,893
I don't want
milk of the poppy.

640
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,078
Do it quickly.

641
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,719
_

642
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:20,895
_

643
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:24,903
_

644
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:30,224
_

645
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:33,032
_

646
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:37,516
_

647
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:41,548
_

648
00:49:41,568 --> 00:49:45,371
_

649
00:49:45,568 --> 00:49:48,478
_

650
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:00,893
_

651
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:04,161
_

652
00:50:04,346 --> 00:50:06,561
_

653
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:11,317
_

654
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,574
_

655
00:50:15,922 --> 00:50:18,038
_

656
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:21,883
_

657
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:26,683
_

658
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:31,290
_

659
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,773
Until the sun
rises in the west

660
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,656
and sets in the east,

661
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:04,240
until the rivers run dry

662
00:51:04,468 --> 00:51:07,783
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

663
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:51,788
They miss their mother.

664
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:54,149
They want to be with you.

665
00:51:54,169 --> 00:51:55,962
Do you want
to be with them?

666
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:57,733
You will be.

667
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:00,741
<i>When your dragons</i>
<i>were born,</i>

668
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:02,938
our magic
was born again.

669
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:05,156
It is strongest
in their presence.

670
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:08,392
And they are strongest
in yours.

671
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:11,411
You will be with them,

672
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:14,472
through winter, summer,

673
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:16,720
and winter again.

674
00:52:17,122 --> 00:52:19,794
Across a thousand
thousand seasons

675
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,647
you will be with them.

676
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:26,013
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

677
00:52:30,674 --> 00:52:33,921
Welcome home,
Daenerys Stormborn.

678
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:36,249
This is not my home.

679
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:37,477
My home is across the sea

680
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:39,833
where my people
are waiting for me.

681
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:42,548
They will be waiting
a long time.

682
00:52:59,705 --> 00:53:01,203
Dracarys.

683
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,161
We should be there
by sundown.

684
00:53:52,498 --> 00:53:54,150
Won't be a fun
night for you.

685
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,153
Mance knows how
to make crows sing.

686
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:01,198
If you know what to say,
you might just make it

687
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:02,834
through the night.

688
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:09,054
Not talking's
not the way to go.

689
00:54:09,575 --> 00:54:11,160
Careful with that.

690
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:13,256
You might cut yourself.

691
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:16,325
Never swung a sword
before, have you?

692
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:18,150
You look like a baby
with a rattle.

693
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,822
<i>Enough of that!</i>

694
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:31,862
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

695
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:35,294
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

696
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,053
Let 'em fight.

697
00:54:57,176 --> 00:54:59,988
That's it?
That's what you can do?

698
00:55:00,347 --> 00:55:01,943
You little shit.

699
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,964
Your traitor father
teach you that?

700
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:15,064
Or was it your whore mother?

701
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:37,219
We are the Watchers
on the Wall.

702
00:55:49,564 --> 00:55:51,737
You can tell Mance

703
00:55:52,387 --> 00:55:55,830
that's the man who killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

704
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,334
- Burn the body.
<i>- Aye.</i>

705
00:56:11,562 --> 00:56:14,614
You don't want this one
coming back for you.

706
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,242
Come along, Jon Snow.

707
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:58,937
Time to meet
the King-Beyond-The-Wall.

708
00:57:45,127 --> 00:57:46,419
What the--?

709
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:54,861
<i>Khaleesi, please.</i>

710
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,131
He said you'd never
leave Qarth alive.

711
00:57:57,151 --> 00:57:58,466
Come.

712
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:31,038
Nothing.

713
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,576
Thank you,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

714
00:58:42,842 --> 00:58:46,141
<i>Thank you for teaching</i>
<i>me this lesson.</i>

715
00:58:48,389 --> 00:58:49,724
I am King of Qarth.

716
00:58:49,744 --> 00:58:52,146
I can help you now,
truly help you.

717
00:58:52,276 --> 00:58:53,776
We can take
the Iron Throne.

718
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,090
- I'll bring you 1,000 ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

719
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,500
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

720
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,254
I beg you, please!

721
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,479
<i>- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

722
00:59:04,065 --> 00:59:05,803
<i>- Khaleesi!</i>

723
00:59:25,892 --> 00:59:27,390
It's all a lie.

724
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:31,259
Looks real enough to me.

725
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,765
Real enough
to buy a ship?

726
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:42,036
Aye, a small ship.

727
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,629
_

728
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:29,891
I thought we were coming
north to fight wildlings.

729
01:00:32,074 --> 01:00:33,714
Is this goat?

730
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,123
It's moose.

731
01:00:36,954 --> 01:00:39,970
People shouldn't live anywhere
you need to burn shit to keep warm.

732
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,532
Well, you see a tree,
let me know.

733
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,436
If you step back
and think about it,

734
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,620
the thing about Gilly
that's so interesting is--

735
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,273
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

736
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:56,407
The thing about her that
I find so interesting is that

737
01:00:56,427 --> 01:00:58,937
after all that
Craster's done to her,

738
01:00:59,111 --> 01:01:01,500
she's still got hope that
life might get better.

739
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:04,606
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

740
01:01:04,736 --> 01:01:07,898
is that she said
six words to you.

741
01:01:08,093 --> 01:01:11,047
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

742
01:01:11,188 --> 01:01:12,861
is absolutely nothing.

743
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,125
It's Jon
and the Halfhand.

744
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:19,404
They're back.

745
01:01:23,944 --> 01:01:25,699
Two blasts is wildlings.

746
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,837
You're not fighting them alone.
Come on.

747
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:34,311
Three blasts?

748
01:01:34,463 --> 01:01:36,027
Run!

749
01:01:42,822 --> 01:01:45,524
Wait! Wait for me!

750
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,075
Grenn!

751
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:52,507
