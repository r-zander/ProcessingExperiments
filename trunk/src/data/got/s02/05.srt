1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:02,613
- Previously on Game of Thrones...
- <i>The wolf pup has gone south.</i>

2
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:04,745
The North is ripe for the taking.

3
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:08,161
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stony Shore

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,977
- I'm to fight fishermen?
- Be careful of their nets.

5
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:12,949
- Lovely boy.
- What do you want?

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,921
You're called Arry?

7
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:16,564
A boy could make a friend.

8
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:19,094
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.

9
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:23,280
<i>Every night it's the same.
I'm running through the godswood howling.</i>

10
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:25,437
These are dreams, nothing more.

11
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,924
My dreams are different.
Mine are true.

12
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:31,199
<i>I saw something take that child.</i>

13
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:34,447
Wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I.

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,229
Ready my horse.
We leave at dawn.

15
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:41,500
Did Cersei have you knighted before or
after she took you into her bed?

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,825
- Nothing to say?
- Mercy! Mercy, My Lord!

17
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:46,053
<i>I want to know what Cersei is doing,...</i>

18
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,629
- and you will tell me.
- Yes, My Lord, I will.

19
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,775
Sweet boy! Help us!

20
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,704
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

21
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,778
<i>We'll take them back to Harrenhal.</i>

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,395
This one's a girl dressed as a boy.

23
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,207
Get these prisoners to work.

24
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,760
<i>Bring the girl.
I need a new cupbearer.</i>

25
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,995
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

26
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,863
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

27
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,629
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

28
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,625
The night is dark and full of terrors.

29
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:14,143
<i>I will vouch for her,
her people and her dragons.</i>

30
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:17,605
Be it on your head.

31
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:19,642
Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.

32
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:23,002
Trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.

33
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,958
<i>- What am I bringing ashore?
- The red woman.</i>

34
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:27,765
<i>No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.</i>

39
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:44,973
You swear it?

40
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:46,853
By the mother.

41
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,247
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

42
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,702
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

43
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,600
Your son can go on calling
himself King in the North,

44
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,217
the Starks will have dominion over
all lands north of Moat Cailin,

45
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,378
- provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
- And the wording of this oath?

46
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:12,606
The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago.

47
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:15,531
Cat,...

48
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:18,018
their friendship held the kingdoms together.

49
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:25,319
And in return for my son's loyalty?

50
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,397
In the morning I'll destroy my brother's army.

51
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,633
When that's done,

52
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:34,294
Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,

53
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,330
as they have done many times before.

54
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,770
Our two houses have always been close,

55
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,085
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

56
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:53,268
- Negotiate a peace with your brother.
- Negotiate with Stannis?

57
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:55,938
You heard him out there.

58
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,801
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

59
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:03,080
Please bring my terms to your son.

60
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:07,253
I believe we are natural allies.
I hope he feels the same.

61
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,965
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

62
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:26,190
No!

63
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,719
- No.
<i>- Follow me!</i>

64
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,966
You'll die for this.

65
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:39,028
No, wait, it wasn't her!

66
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,793
We've got to leave.

67
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,221
They'll hang you for this.

68
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,558
<i>- Inside the king's tent, go!</i>
- Now!

69
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:34,538
I won't leave him.

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,685
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

71
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,913
- <i>Over there, go!</i>
- Not that way.

72
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,579
We need to go home.

73
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:23,844
- Loras.
- My Lord, My Lady.

74
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:24,874
Get out.

75
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,333
Stannis will be here in an hour.

76
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,652
When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

77
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:35,193
Your former companions will fight for the
privilege of selling you to their new king.

78
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,769
And you want that privilege for yourself.

79
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,473
You will note that I am
standing here talking to you,

80
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:41,494
not Stannis.

81
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:44,490
- There's no time for this.
- Ride back to Highgarden, sister.

82
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,203
I'm not running from Stannis.

83
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,873
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

84
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,340
I don't believe that.

85
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,143
You don't believe that.

86
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,264
Who gained the most from our king's death?

87
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:56,642
Stannis.

88
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:59,227
I will put a sword through his righteous face.

89
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,637
You can't stay here.

90
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:03,398
He would have been a true king,

91
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:05,894
a good king.

92
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,235
Tell me, Ser Loras,

93
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:11,607
what do you desire most in this world?

94
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:12,746
Revenge.

95
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:16,283
I have always found that to
be the purest of motivations,

96
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,944
but you won't have a chance to
put your sword through Stannis,

97
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,047
not today.

98
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,781
You'll be cut to pieces before
he sets foot on solid ground.

99
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,582
If it is justice that you want,

100
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:26,657
be smart about it.

101
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,579
You can't avenge him from the grave.

102
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,746
Bring the horses.

103
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,608
Please.

104
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,621
He was very handsome.

105
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:09,833
He was, Your Grace.

106
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:11,576
"Your Grace."

107
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:16,166
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

108
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:18,875
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

109
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,319
- Do you want to be a queen?
- No.

110
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,060
<i>I want to be the queen.</i>

111
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,291
Killed?

112
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,895
- By whom?
- Accounts differ.

113
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:46,870
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.

114
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,607
Really? Who'd have thought?

115
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:51,159
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

116
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,791
while still others say it was
Stannis himself who did it

117
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,866
after negotiations went sour.

118
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,902
Whomever did it, I say well done.

119
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,490
It's not what Varys says.

120
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,541
He says Renly's army is
flocking to support Stannis,

121
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,852
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

122
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,223
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

123
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:11,552
And I say father raised you to
have too much respect for money.

124
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:15,020
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

125
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,984
Aren't there other things you should be doing,
like sealing my daughter in a crate,...

126
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:20,229
- so you can ship her away?
- She'll be safer in Dorne.

127
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:23,994
- Yes, I know how concerned you are for
her safety. - It so happens that I am.

128
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:28,522
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.

129
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,002
So clever.

130
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:34,824
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

131
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,082
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

132
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:39,962
They are going to attack us.

133
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:43,991
- We need to be ready.
- No need to concern yourself over it.

134
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:47,853
The king is taking personal
charge of siege preparations.

135
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:51,141
May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?

136
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:55,569
You may specifically or you may ask vaguely.
The answer will be the same.

137
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,609
It's important that we talk about this.

138
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,158
It's the king's royal prerogative

139
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:13,764
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

140
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,691
<i>It's wildfire.</i>

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,242
Wildfire?

142
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,302
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

143
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,530
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

144
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:35,405
It is not a lie.
Why would I lie?

145
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,119
Tell me,

146
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,948
if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,

147
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:45,586
do you think it will make Jaime more
likely to kill you or less likely?

148
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:49,414
When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

149
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,323
- I'm telling you the truth.
- The smart money would be on more likely.

150
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:55,252
- She's making wildfire.
- But then perhaps his own unnatural urges,...

151
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,453
will give him sympathy for yours.
- The alchemists' guild is,...

152
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,431
- being commissioned.
- I suppose there's only one way to find out.

153
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:02,447
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

154
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,462
They are planning to launch
them from the city walls,...

155
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:06,791
into Stannis's ships and armies.

156
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:07,821
Please.

157
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,740
When did she tell you this?

158
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,635
I heard her talking with the Pyromancer.

159
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:17,771
And the other night,...

160
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,862
after I left her,

161
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,818
she went to meet him.

162
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:24,248
- I swear to you.
- Swear to me on what?

163
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,682
- On my life.
- But I don't care about your life.

164
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:31,321
In the Light of the Seven,
by all that is holy and right,

165
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,951
- I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...
- All right, all right.

166
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:37,434
Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.

167
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:38,777
Just get out.

168
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:47,999
Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill
you if anything should happen to me.

169
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,329
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

170
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,175
It will be my pleasure.

171
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:00,542
Your Grace.

172
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,251
What is it?

173
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,132
<i>I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.</i>

174
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:07,351
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

175
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:09,952
- Your Grace. - Fools love a fool.
- Your Grace.

176
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,784
I grieve for him as well,
for the boy he was,

177
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,272
not the man he grew to be.

178
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:16,392
I need to speak to you about
what I saw in that cave.

179
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,811
I thought I made it clear to you there'd
be no need to speak to me on this matter.

180
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,591
- Your Grace, I... - I've never known
you to need to hear a thing twice.

181
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:26,412
And I've never known you to hide from the truth.

182
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,710
- You've come to lecture me on truth?
- I've come to tell you that what I saw...

183
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,437
All my brother's bannermen have come to my side.

184
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,763
Except the Tyrells,
who fled like cowards.

185
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,151
They won't be able to resist us now.
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

186
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:42,721
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the Iron...

187
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:44,701
I'll hear no more about it.

188
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,118
<i>Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.</i>

189
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:57,803
When do we sail for King's Landing?

190
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,283
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

191
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,245
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

192
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:08,175
we'll deliver our troops to their
doorstep and take the city.

193
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:10,791
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

194
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,762
That's not your concern.

195
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,793
If you take King's Landing with her by your side,

196
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,501
- the victory will be hers. - I never thought
I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty.

197
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,931
Was I wrong?

198
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:23,182
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

199
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,812
Truth again.

200
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,625
All right, what's the truth?

201
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,530
- The hard truth?
- She's a foreigner,...

202
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:34,748
preaching her foreign religion.

203
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:38,872
Some believe she whispers orders
in your ear and you obey.

204
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:43,559
What do you believe?

205
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,853
You won those bannermen from Renly.

206
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,791
Don't lose them to her.

207
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:00,984
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

208
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:06,493
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

209
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,482
Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time
on the sea was spent evading ships,

210
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,763
not attacking them.
The other lords won't be happy.

211
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:18,465
Most of those lords should consider
themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason.

212
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,262
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

213
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:43,132
<i>I've got it! I've got it!</i>

214
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:45,923
<i>So it's that one there
at the top, on the right.</i>

215
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:50,404
Buy my fruit, My Lord. Fresh fruit.

216
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:54,481
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

217
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:55,861
What do we have?

218
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,354
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

219
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:01,932
Well, I've never actually been
able to kill people with it.

220
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,712
Good thing.
I'd be out of a job.

221
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:06,861
What about your father?

222
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,937
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

223
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,881
He's very busy.

224
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:15,861
Being repeatedly humiliated by
Robb Stark is time-consuming.

225
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,621
We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis,
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

226
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,891
<i>Corruption, yes.</i>

227
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,509
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

228
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,024
Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of Kings

229
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,404
and we're surprised when the
fruit of their incest is rotten?

230
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,033
Yes, a rotten king.

231
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:40,292
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

232
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,331
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

233
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:45,111
The King is a lost cause.

234
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:48,067
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

235
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,747
A dancing king, prancing
down his bloodstained halls

236
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:55,720
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

237
00:16:57,613 --> 00:16:59,910
You have to admire his imagination.

238
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,385
He's talking about you.

239
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:03,302
What?

240
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,300
- Demon monkey?
- People think you're pulling the king's strings.

241
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,483
They blame you for the city's ills.

242
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:13,513
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

243
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,894
<i>- You don't need to convince me.
- Demon monkey.</i>

244
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:50,564
- Yeah, come on.
- You're the crew of the sea bitch?

245
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,561
I'm your commander.
Welcome.

246
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:57,601
Stop.

247
00:17:58,801 --> 00:17:59,801
Stop!

248
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:03,413
Your Captain commands you to stop.

249
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,074
Where are we heading, Captain?

250
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,246
The Stony Shore to raid their villages.

251
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:15,003
There'll be spoils in it for you,
and women, if you do your jobs well.

252
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:17,983
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

253
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:20,713
I do.

254
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,456
Your Captain.

255
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:28,269
I have been reaving and raping

256
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:31,967
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

257
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,850
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

258
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:40,030
Don't reckon I've got
much use for a captain at all.

259
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:44,203
I'm thinking I can do the job
of captain real well myself.

260
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,336
All I need is a ship.

261
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:51,074
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

262
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:56,869
You could do that,

263
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,997
take the ship, head out on your own.

264
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:03,131
And I will hunt you down, drag you back
here in chains, and hang you for a traitor.

265
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,465
Stop. We yield.

266
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,630
Congratulations on your first command.

267
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,622
Thank you.
Kind of you to come see me off.

268
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,525
I'm not here for you.

269
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,983
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.

270
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:20,783
I've got 30 ships...

271
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:24,207
There's nowhere to put them here.
Too narrow.

272
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:28,538
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want them to set sail without you.

273
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,317
That would never happen.

274
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:34,098
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

275
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,168
This lot, though...

276
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:39,955
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

277
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,748
Come on, I'll take you out.

278
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:51,640
- Who are you?
- Dagmer, your first mate.

279
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:55,221
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

280
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:59,101
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

281
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,274
That would be good for a laugh.

282
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:03,372
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

283
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:06,865
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

284
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:07,895
You're not.

285
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,394
And yet that's the task my father has given me

286
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:14,316
to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.

287
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:16,900
They're all Iron Islanders.

288
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:20,617
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

289
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,322
The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.

290
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:33,229
The seat of the House of Tallhart,...

291
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,206
a more impressive prize than
a few fishermen's daughters.

292
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:40,596
- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.

293
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,727
We could never hold it for more than a few days.

294
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:45,090
As soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

295
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,838
the Starks would send their men to take it back.

296
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:51,326
And then...

297
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:59,657
Take me to my ship.

298
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,633
The Starks have overextended their lines.

299
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:10,541
Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard
time keeping their men and horses fed.

300
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,904
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

301
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,882
The cold won't beat them.

302
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:19,491
Our spies report growing
discontent among the northern lords.

303
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,966
They want to return home and gather
the harvest before the crops turn.

304
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:27,109
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

305
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:30,375
they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

306
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:33,259
This is war:
No one's content.

307
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:38,189
We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long.

308
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:41,556
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

309
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,667
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

310
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:51,614
You've been waiting for him to fail.
He is not going to fail,

311
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:54,238
not without our help.

312
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,681
So how do we stop him?

313
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:01,190
We've worked through the night, My Lord.

314
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,386
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

315
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:05,586
As I think you would, Reginald.

316
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,816
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

317
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:13,444
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

318
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:17,610
- My wife's in Lannisport.
- Well, then you'd better start riding.

319
00:22:18,623 --> 00:22:22,093
Go before I change my mind and send her your head.

320
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,005
If your name wasn't Lannister,
you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent.

321
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:28,035
Go!

322
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,226
Not wine, water.

323
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:35,745
We'll be here for some time.

324
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:41,910
Girl.

325
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:44,658
Where are you from?

326
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:46,842
Maidenpool, My Lord.

327
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:51,210
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

328
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:53,865
House Mooton, My Lord.

329
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:55,875
And what is their sigil?

330
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,793
A red salmon.

331
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:04,911
I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.

332
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,769
You're a northerner, aren't you?

333
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:12,380
Good.
One more time, where are you from?

334
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:14,423
Barrowton, My Lord.

335
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:15,973
House Dustin.

336
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:19,501
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

337
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:25,244
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?

338
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,718
They call him the Young Wolf.

339
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:31,831
And?

340
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:35,883
They say he rides into battle on
the back of a giant direwolf.

341
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,974
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

342
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,021
They say he can't be killed.

343
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,068
And do you believe them?

344
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:49,816
No, My Lord.

345
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:52,758
Anyone can be killed.

346
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,535
Fetch that water.

347
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,770
A girl says nothing.

348
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:50,249
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

349
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,697
No one hears,

350
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:56,343
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

351
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:02,667
A boy becomes a girl.

352
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:05,785
- I was always a girl.
- And I was always aware.

353
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:08,779
But the girl keeps secrets.

354
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:12,320
It is not for a man to spoil them.

355
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,283
You're one of them now.

356
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:20,722
I should have let you burn.

357
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:25,888
And you fetch water for one of them now.

358
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,310
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

359
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:32,670
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.

360
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:35,231
I did.

361
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:38,015
And here we are.

362
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:42,506
A man pays his debts.

363
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,723
A man owes three.

364
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,288
Three what?

365
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,128
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

366
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,651
And only death may pay for life.

367
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:57,267
You saved me and the two I was with.

368
00:25:57,297 --> 00:25:59,497
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

369
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:05,734
We have to give them back.

370
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,948
Speak three names,...

371
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,872
and the man will do the rest.

372
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,822
Three lives I will give you,
no more, no less,

373
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:20,936
and we're done.

374
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,979
I can name anyone

375
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:25,639
and you'll kill him?

376
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,651
A man has said.

377
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:33,228
The one who tortures everyone.

378
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,260
- A man needs a name.
- I don't know his name.

379
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,118
- They call him the Tickler.
- That is enough.

380
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,122
Go now, girl.

381
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,323
Your master is thirsty.

382
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,152
He's not here yet.
He'd have seen us,...

383
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:03,991
- blown the horn.
- When will he come?

384
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:06,862
The Halfhand does things in his own time.

385
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:10,832
- My uncle told me stories about him.
- Most of them are true.

386
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,313
I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the wall.

387
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:18,168
The whole winter. He was north of
the Skirling Pass when the snows came.

388
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:20,264
Had to wait for the thaw.

389
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:24,018
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

390
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:27,240
Well, possible for the Halfhand.

391
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,056
Beautiful, isn't it?

392
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:31,804
Gilly would love it here.

393
00:27:32,104 --> 00:27:35,133
There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.

394
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,473
<i>About time you did something.</i>

395
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:07,605
<i>At least you'll keep warm.</i>

396
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:11,445
The fist of the First Men.

397
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,128
Think of how old this place is...

398
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,337
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

399
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:21,099
before the Andals took
Westeros from the First Men.

400
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:24,028
Before I die, please, stop talking.

401
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:26,456
Thousands and thousands of years ago,

402
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:29,703
the First Men stood here where we're standing

403
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,668
all through the long night.

404
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:36,318
What do you think they were like, the First Men?

405
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:37,858
Stupid.

406
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:41,417
Smart people don't find
themselves in places like this.

407
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,237
I think they were afraid.

408
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,224
I think they came here to get away from something.

409
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,794
And I don't think it worked.

410
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,710
Wildlings?

411
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:01,663
One blast is for rangers returning.

412
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:03,407
Wildlings is two blasts.

413
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:06,415
So you got to stand there waiting,

414
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:08,983
wondering.

415
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,979
One blast for friends,

416
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,916
two for foes.

417
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,964
And three for White Walkers.

418
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,193
It's been 1,000 years,

419
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,527
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

420
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,099
But if it's been 1,000 years,
how do you know?

421
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:32,031
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

422
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,489
Look.

423
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:38,273
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

424
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:39,308
<i>Aye</i>,

425
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:41,334
we'll live another day.

426
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:43,311
Hurrah.

427
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:55,165
Take care, My Lord.

428
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:59,409
I remember reading an old sailor's proverb...

429
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:01,877
"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

430
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:05,968
I have not conducted this experiment.

431
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:08,097
It could well be true.

432
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:10,266
The substance burns so hot,

433
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:13,174
it melts wood, stone, even steel,

434
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:16,014
and, of course, flesh.

435
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:21,164
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

436
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:29,577
After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.

437
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:33,014
My companion takes issue.

438
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:35,190
If I could tell you how many crazy old men

439
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,599
I've seen pushing carts around army camps

440
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:40,788
making grand claims about jars full of pig shit...

441
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:44,606
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

442
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:47,342
The substance is fire given form.

443
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:50,339
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

444
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:51,386
To do what?

445
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:55,750
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

446
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:57,428
How much do you have?

447
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:05,124
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

448
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:08,526
then maybe you'd hit your target one time in 10,

449
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,699
but all the real soldiers are in
the Riverlands with your father.

450
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,697
My Lord, this man is insulting.

451
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:17,594
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
old man, but things can get a bit messy.

452
00:31:17,624 --> 00:31:19,770
'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,

453
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,274
he's flinging them right back at us.

454
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:24,344
Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

455
00:31:24,374 --> 00:31:26,064
which means pots falling,

456
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,913
which means fire inside the walls,

457
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:30,440
which means the poor cunts
trying to defend the city

458
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,470
end up burning it down.

459
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,050
My friend remains unconvinced.

460
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:38,957
He would not dare insult my order
whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

461
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:41,789
Well, he's not living anymore.

462
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,357
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

463
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:49,287
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

464
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:08,242
We have been working tirelessly day and night

465
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:12,470
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

466
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,979
Our present count stands,...

467
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:18,516
at 7,811,...

468
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,963
enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet

469
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:23,806
and armies both.

470
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,964
This is a shit idea.

471
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:30,847
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.

472
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:34,779
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

473
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:39,722
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

474
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:44,315
You'll be making it for me.

475
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:55,540
Dracarys.

476
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:05,222
Dracarys.

477
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,744
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

478
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,816
Let him sleep, Doreah.

479
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,936
Yes, Khaleesi.

480
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:30,035
He loves you.

481
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,636
<b>I rewove this part of the top.</b>

482
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:41,481
<b>And I fixed the heal on this one.</b>

483
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,624
Thank you, my friend.

484
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,883
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

485
00:33:49,614 --> 00:33:52,649
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

486
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:54,011
It is known.

487
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,589
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...

488
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,076
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

489
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:05,594
<b>May he ride forever
through the night lands.</b>

490
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:11,064
Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.

491
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:14,838
Men like to talk about other men

492
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:16,445
when they're happy.

493
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,108
You would look like a real princess in Xaro's...

494
00:34:26,138 --> 00:34:28,774
She's not a princess.
She's a Khaleesi.

495
00:34:35,427 --> 00:34:37,740
You should wear it, Khaleesi.

496
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,192
You are their guest.

497
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:41,048
It would be rude not to.

498
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:04,669
And you must visit the night market.

499
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:09,094
The Qartheen night market is like
no night market you've ever seen.

500
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,512
It sounds wonderful.

501
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,004
The Meereens think they have a night market.

502
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:15,301
I will take you there myself.

503
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:17,977
Please excuse me for a moment.

504
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,510
What are they doing?

505
00:35:23,544 --> 00:35:26,798
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.

506
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,816
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.

507
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:31,389
They can pry out the gems,
the rest is pure gold.

508
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:34,659
Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.

509
00:35:34,786 --> 00:35:36,651
<b>Or melt it. Very simple.</b>

510
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:37,971
<b>We are his guests!</b>

511
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:40,937
<b>You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.</b>

512
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:42,890
<b>Of course not, Khaleesi!</b>

513
00:35:43,013 --> 00:35:44,966
<b>We will wait until we leave.</b>

514
00:35:45,257 --> 00:35:46,752
<b>Not even when we leave.</b>

515
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,538
<b>Why not?</b>

516
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:51,510
<b>Our hosts saved us from the Red Waste
and you want to steal from him?</b>

517
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,109
<b>I will hear no more.</b>

518
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:05,438
My brother used to say the only
thing the Dothraki knew how to do

519
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:07,303
was steal things better men have built.

520
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,957
It's not the only thing.

521
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:11,421
They're quite good at killing the better men.

522
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:13,506
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

523
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:15,419
Mother of Dragons.

524
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:19,367
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,

525
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:20,759
I welcome you.

526
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:24,089
A demonstration?

527
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,142
Take this gem.

528
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:30,210
Look at it.

529
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,708
Into its depths.

530
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,016
So many facets.

531
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:40,079
Look closely enough and you
can see yourself in them.

532
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,215
Often more than once.

533
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:51,255
Should you grow tired of
Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

534
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,515
it would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying.

535
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,109
You're always welcome,

536
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,247
Mother of Dragons.

537
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:08,351
My apologies.

538
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:10,911
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.

539
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:13,925
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

540
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,747
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

541
00:37:17,162 --> 00:37:19,568
What is the House of the Undying?

542
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:23,132
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

543
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,175
and drink shade of the evening.

544
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:27,076
It turns their lips blue,

545
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:28,865
and their minds soft,...

546
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,013
so soft, they actually believe

547
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:34,413
their parlor tricks are magic.

548
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:40,399
You watch over her.

549
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,147
- Do I know you?
- I know you.

550
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,383
Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

551
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:50,955
Who are you?

552
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:53,231
I'm no one.

553
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:55,504
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

554
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:58,767
She needs true protectors now more than ever.

555
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:04,061
They shall come day and night to see
the wonder born into the world again.

556
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:06,777
And when they see, they shall lust,

557
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:10,252
for dragons are fire made flesh.

558
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,383
And fire is power.

559
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:25,775
It looked like Stannis.

560
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:29,523
To me it just looked like,...

561
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:35,532
a shadow in the shape of a man.

562
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,526
In the shape of Stannis.

563
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:45,361
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

564
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,275
Will you stay there long, My Lady?

565
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:50,284
Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.

566
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,895
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

567
00:38:55,658 --> 00:38:58,148
My two youngest need me.

568
00:38:58,178 --> 00:39:00,418
I've been away from them for far too long.

569
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:03,657
I never knew my mother.

570
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,098
I'm sorry.

571
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:10,034
My own mother died on the birthing bed,

572
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,784
when I was very young.

573
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,918
It's a bloody business.

574
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:21,347
What comes after is even harder.

575
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:26,420
Once you're safely back amongst your own people,

576
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,163
will you give me leave to go, My Lady?

577
00:39:30,374 --> 00:39:32,000
You mean to kill Stannis.

578
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:33,890
I swore a vow.

579
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,802
But Stannis has a great army around him.

580
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:40,232
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

581
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:42,212
I'm as good as any of them.

582
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,189
I should never have fled.

583
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,633
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

584
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,207
You served him bravely.

585
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,335
I only held him that once,

586
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:56,485
as he was dying.

587
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,069
He's gone, Brienne.

588
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,619
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

589
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:09,472
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

590
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:17,256
I do not know your son, My Lady,...

591
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:20,658
but I could serve you,...

592
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,918
if you would have me.

593
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:25,522
You have courage.

594
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:28,322
Not battle courage, perhaps,

595
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:30,197
but, I don't know,

596
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:33,413
a woman's kind of courage.

597
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:34,621
And I think,...

598
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:36,983
that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

599
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:40,747
Promise me that you will
not hold me back from Stannis.

600
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:49,483
When the time comes, I will not hold you back.

601
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:58,649
Then I am yours, My Lady.

602
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:01,729
I will shield your back

603
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,564
and give my life for yours if it comes to that.

604
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:07,778
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

605
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:18,646
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home,...

606
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:20,833
and at my table,...

607
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:24,676
and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonor.

608
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:28,619
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

609
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:34,762
<i>And it's not just thieves, My Lord.</i>

610
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:37,440
There's wolves in them hills now,

611
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,095
more than I've ever seen.

612
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:41,845
They come down in the night and they,...

613
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,375
kill my sheep.

614
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,979
My three sons is away fighting
for your brother, My Lord.

615
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:49,321
They'll fight, keep fighting,...

616
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:51,336
till they're told to go home.

617
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:54,649
I have no one to man my flock now.
Only me.

618
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,830
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

619
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,545
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you,...

620
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:04,162
to help watch over your flock,...

621
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,116
if you can give them room and board.

622
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:09,091
My wife always prayed for more children.

623
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:11,399
We'll look after them.
Thank you, My Lord.

624
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:14,499
And may the Gods bless you and yours.

625
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:18,718
Stop it.

626
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:23,041
If that's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

627
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:24,454
Good.

628
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:25,799
- Hodor.
- Hodor.

629
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:28,066
Bran...
Lord Stark.

630
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,937
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

631
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,772
Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.

632
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:36,755
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

633
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:39,455
Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain.

634
00:42:39,485 --> 00:42:41,606
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

635
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:44,397
- We have to help them.
- Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,

636
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:46,292
but I can gather 200 decent men.

637
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:49,477
- Do you need so many?
- If we can't protect our own bannermen,

638
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:51,703
why should they protect us?

639
00:42:52,095 --> 00:42:53,657
Go, Ser Rodrik.

640
00:42:53,687 --> 00:42:56,055
- Take the men you need.
- Won't take long, My Lord.

641
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:58,335
Southerners don't do well up here.

642
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:12,350
- So, what does it mean?
- Ask your Maester Luwin.

643
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:15,854
- He's the one studying books all the time.
- I did ask him.

644
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:17,930
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

645
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,016
Must not mean anything, then.

646
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:21,174
You're lying.

647
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:24,444
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

648
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,453
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

649
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,548
You didn't give me an honest answer.

650
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,866
That's not the same as being a liar.

651
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:33,527
Well, it's not far off.

652
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:34,727
So,...

653
00:43:34,976 --> 00:43:37,976
you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again?

654
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,258
In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream.

655
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,745
Now who's a liar?

656
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,032
What did you see in your dream?

657
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:54,797
Something bad?

658
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,518
Tell me, boy.

659
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,021
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

660
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:08,417
I saw waves crashing against the gates,...

661
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,534
and the water came flowing over the walls,...

662
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:16,034
flooded the castle.

663
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:21,043
Drowned men were floating here,...

664
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:22,756
in the yard.

665
00:44:25,768 --> 00:44:27,682
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

666
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,648
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

667
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:34,783
I know.

668
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:38,366
- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

669
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,280
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

670
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,310
Osha.

671
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:44,129
The three-eyed raven,

672
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,574
what do they say about it,

673
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,852
north of the wall?

674
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,275
They say all sorts of crazy
things north of the wall.

675
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:05,476
There.

676
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:07,943
- Where?
- On that mountain.

677
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:10,839
I don't see very well.

678
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:12,836
A fire.

679
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:17,348
There's a fire.

680
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:21,710
The people sitting around it have
better eyes than yours or mine.

681
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,622
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

682
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:28,341
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honor.

683
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:30,214
How many wildlings have joined him?

684
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:32,230
From what we can tell,

685
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,264
all of them.

686
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,435
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

687
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,668
They're almost ready to make their move.

688
00:45:44,585 --> 00:45:46,590
- Where?
- Somewhere safe.

689
00:45:47,134 --> 00:45:48,555
Somewhere south.

690
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,026
Can't just march into their midst.

691
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:55,724
And we can't wait for them here with
nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.

692
00:45:56,407 --> 00:45:59,258
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

693
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:01,575
Mance was one of us once.

694
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,945
Now he's one of them.

695
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:06,736
He's gonna teach them our way of doing things.

696
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:09,285
They'll hit us in force.

697
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:11,794
And they won't run away when we hit back.

698
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:13,810
They're gonna be more organized than before,

699
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,291
more disciplined,...

700
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,730
more like us.

701
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:20,844
So we need to be more like them,

702
00:46:20,984 --> 00:46:22,832
do things their way.

703
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:24,696
Sneak in,...

704
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,920
kill Mance,...

705
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:29,604
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

706
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:32,801
- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.

707
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,723
It's not a job for 400 men.

708
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:36,725
I need to move fast,...

709
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:37,904
and silent.

710
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:39,531
Harker,

711
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
Stonesnake,

712
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:41,828
Borba.

713
00:46:42,997 --> 00:46:44,193
Lord Commander,

714
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:46,123
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

715
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:48,075
I've been called lots of things,

716
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,084
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

717
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:53,600
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

718
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:55,709
I've fought and killed a White.

719
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,709
How many rangers can say that?

720
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:58,805
He's the one?

721
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:01,969
<i>Aye.</i>

722
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:03,821
You killed a White.

723
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:06,178
You also let an old man beat you bloody,

724
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,483
and take your sword.

725
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:10,421
Craster?

726
00:47:10,624 --> 00:47:14,101
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

727
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:20,107
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, My Lord.

728
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:22,239
It would be no trouble.

729
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,686
Well, I hope you make a better ranger

730
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:35,773
than you do a steward.

731
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:38,733
Go on.

732
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:47,811
So, tell me,

733
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:51,416
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

734
00:47:51,863 --> 00:47:54,695
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

735
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:57,288
He's my advisor,

736
00:47:57,905 --> 00:47:59,005
my friend.

737
00:47:59,163 --> 00:48:00,446
Unlikely.

738
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:03,765
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

739
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:05,687
And what about what a woman wants?

740
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,682
Much more complicated.

741
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:09,383
You, for example,

742
00:48:10,383 --> 00:48:11,972
what do you want?

743
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:15,675
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

744
00:48:15,705 --> 00:48:16,705
Why?

745
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:21,213
Because I promised my Khalasar I'd protect
them and find them a safe home.

746
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,603
You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

747
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:27,064
I want them because they're mine by right.

748
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:29,899
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

749
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,287
A conqueror.

750
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:35,010
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

751
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,997
No.

752
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:37,533
I come from nothing.

753
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:39,795
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

754
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:42,046
except someone normally
cares what happens to cargo.

755
00:48:42,076 --> 00:48:44,924
So you wanted more than you had and you took it.

756
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:47,576
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just,...

757
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:49,297
less ambitious.

758
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:55,607
What do you want, Xaro Zhoan Daxos?

759
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:59,198
At the gates of the city,
you bled for me.

760
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,228
Why?

761
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:04,371
I will show you why.

762
00:49:08,303 --> 00:49:11,282
The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.

763
00:49:11,874 --> 00:49:14,658
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

764
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:18,506
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth

765
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:21,015
their weight in gold if they could break into it.

766
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,676
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

767
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,290
They all went home empty-handed.

768
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:29,270
The only thing that can open this door

769
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:31,116
is this key.

770
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,743
And behind the door?

771
00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:38,527
And it can all be mine?

772
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:39,623
All?

773
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,666
Let us say half.

774
00:49:43,878 --> 00:49:46,603
More than enough to buy horses, ships,...

775
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:48,206
armies.

776
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,041
Enough to go home.

777
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:52,560
All I have to do?

778
00:49:53,612 --> 00:49:54,612
Is marry me.

779
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:57,466
That was a romantic proposal.

780
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,378
I've already married once for love,

781
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:02,387
but the Gods stole her from me.

782
00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:06,889
I come from nothing.

783
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,142
My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.

784
00:50:10,172 --> 00:50:12,900
But marry me and I will
give you the Seven Kingdoms

785
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:16,500
and our children will be princes and princesses.

786
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,549
See?

787
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:23,437
I have more ambition than you thought.

788
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:28,767
The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen,
first of your name.

789
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:32,287
Robert Baratheon is dead.

790
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,089
If you cross the sea with an army you bought...

791
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,735
The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.

792
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:46,165
Four false kings destroying the country.

793
00:50:46,195 --> 00:50:49,048
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

794
00:50:49,078 --> 00:50:51,109
The Usurper is dead.

795
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:54,813
The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

796
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:58,336
According to your new friend who
earned your trust by cutting his hand?

797
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:00,005
The time to strike is now.

798
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:01,764
We need to find ships and
an army or we'll spend,...

799
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:04,034
the rest of our lives rotting
away at the edge of the world.

800
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,707
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

801
00:51:06,737 --> 00:51:09,904
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

802
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,931
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

803
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:14,577
And if I'd listened to that advice outside,

804
00:51:14,578 --> 00:51:17,190
the gates of Qarth,
we'd all be dead by now.

805
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,572
I know the opportunity before you,

806
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:20,825
seems like the last you'll ever have,
but you must...

807
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:23,305
Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

808
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,778
- I only want...
- What do you want?

809
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:29,949
Tell me.

810
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,673
To see you on the Iron Throne.

811
00:51:32,703 --> 00:51:33,703
Why?

812
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:35,582
You have a good claim.

813
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:36,612
A title.

814
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:38,316
A birthright.

815
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:41,081
But you have something more than that.

816
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:45,911
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

817
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:49,721
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

818
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:53,296
Someone who can rule and should rule.

819
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:56,957
Centuries come and go without a
person like that coming into the world.

820
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:00,168
There are times when I look at you,...

821
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:02,742
and still can't believe you're real.

822
00:52:14,477 --> 00:52:17,412
So what would you have me do as my advisor?

823
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,165
Make your own way.

824
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:28,540
Find your own ship.
You only need one.

825
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:32,229
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

826
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:35,023
And how do I get the ship?

827
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,112
I'll find it for you.

828
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:40,077
A sound ship with a good captain.

829
00:52:46,086 --> 00:52:47,891
I look forward to meeting him.

830
00:52:51,957 --> 00:52:52,957
Khaleesi.

831
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,201
You should stand sideface.

832
00:53:25,558 --> 00:53:26,650
Sideface?

833
00:53:28,277 --> 00:53:29,277
Sideways.

834
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,090
Why?

835
00:53:31,443 --> 00:53:33,291
Smaller target.

836
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:37,624
Am I fighting someone?

837
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:39,589
You're practicing for a fight.

838
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:43,079
You should practice right.

839
00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:46,985
<i>Guards!</i>

840
00:53:47,787 --> 00:53:48,787
<i>Help.</i>

841
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:51,217
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

842
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:54,373
<i>Go up there.</i>

843
00:53:54,574 --> 00:53:56,379
<i>Go and see where he fell from.</i>

844
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,600
<i>Go up the back.</i>

845
00:54:02,786 --> 00:54:04,156
<i>That is strange.</i>

846
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:12,174
<i>Move away.</i>

847
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:16,610
<i>Stand back. He's dead.</i>

848
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
