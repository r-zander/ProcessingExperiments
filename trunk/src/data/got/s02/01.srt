1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,990
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:06,460
<i>I have a son, you have a daughter,
we'll join our houses.</i>

3
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:10,365
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,600
<i>and his sister
Daenerys?</i>

5
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,637
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

6
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:20,108
Maester says the boy may live.

7
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:23,079
My dear brother, there are times you
make me wonder whose side you're on.

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,846
You know how much
I love my family.

9
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,882
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

10
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,445
<i>The Starks have manned the wall
for thousands of years.</i>

11
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:30,828
<i>And you are a Stark.</i>

12
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:34,570
<i>King Robert's bastards...
Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?</i>

13
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:36,626
<i>The King has
no trueborn sons.</i>

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,428
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,730
<i>- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.</i>

16
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:43,667
<i>When the King returns from
his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.</i>

17
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,803
I want what I came for. I want
the crown he promised me.

18
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,634
- No! No!
- A crown for a king.

19
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,897
<i>He was no dragon.
Fire cannot kill the dragon.</i>

20
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:56,494
<i>Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont</i>

21
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:58,923
<i>has requested you for his personal steward.</i>

22
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,284
He wants to groom you for command.

23
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:02,885
Ned! We were hunting.

24
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:05,918
By the time Robert dies, it will be
too late for the both of us.

25
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:07,990
What about Stannis?
He's your older brother.

26
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,991
<i>This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.</i>

27
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,893
He's not a king.
I am.

28
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:15,029
- We have a new king now.
- Your son has no claim to the throne.

29
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:17,331
Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!

30
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,487
You're summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,636
Joffrey puts my father in chains;
Now he wants his ass kissed?

32
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:25,972
I'll go to King's Landing, but not alone.

33
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,441
<i>Call the Banners.</i>

34
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:31,864
<i>- Kill him, Robb.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.</i>

35
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:33,814
So long as I am your king,

36
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:36,384
<i>treason shall never go unpunished.</i>

37
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:38,519
- No! No!
- Stop, my son.

38
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,987
You will go to King's Landing

39
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:42,156
and serve as Hand of the King in my stead.

40
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,793
<i>You'll bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother, too, if needs be.</i>

41
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,628
Please let me go home.

42
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:49,529
Mother says I'm still to marry you,

43
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,832
so you'll stay here and obey.

44
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:55,134
My sword is yours in victory and defeat.

45
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,904
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

46
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,303
- What's your name?
- Arry.

47
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:01,769
Arry the orphan boy.

48
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:04,611
It's 1,000 leagues from here to the Wall.

49
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,679
We ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.

50
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:08,648
<i>The Night's Watch will ride in force</i>

51
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,883
<i>against the wildlings, the White Walkers,</i>

52
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,587
<i>and whatever else is out there.</i>

53
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,287
He will die tonight, Khaleesi.

54
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:18,420
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

55
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,860
You don't understand.

56
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:24,464
Blood of my blood.

61
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,338
Well struck.

62
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,140
Well struck, Dog.

63
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:51,879
Did you like that?

64
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,780
It was well struck,
Your Grace.

65
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,662
I already said
it was well struck.

66
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:59,219
Yes, Your Grace.

67
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:09,425
<i>- Who's next?
- Lothor Brune,</i>

68
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,601
freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

69
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:16,071
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

70
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,577
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

71
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,146
<i>Here I am.</i>

72
00:05:23,414 --> 00:05:24,949
Here I am.

73
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,120
Sorry, Your Grace.

74
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,724
My deepest apologies.

75
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:37,853
<i>- Are you drunk?
- No.</i>

76
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,262
Uh, no.
No, Your Grace.

77
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,064
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

78
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:45,267
That's not much at all.

79
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,769
Please, have another cup.

80
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,047
Are you sure, Your Grace?

81
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,507
<i>Yes. To celebrate my name day.</i>

82
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,244
Have two.
Have as much as you like.

83
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,577
I would be honored, Your Grace.

84
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:02,139
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day.

85
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,641
See that he drinks his fill.

86
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:23,955
You can't.

87
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:26,410
What did you say?

88
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,446
Did you say I can't?

89
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,936
I only meant...

90
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,917
it would be bad luck to kill
a man on your name day.

91
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,632
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

92
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:38,087
<i>The girl is right.</i>

93
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,075
<i>What a man sows on his name day</i>

94
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:41,813
he reaps all year.

95
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,780
Take him away.

96
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

97
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,966
He is. A fool...
You're so clever to see it.

98
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:58,575
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

99
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,912
He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

100
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,149
Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos?

101
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:09,344
From this day,
you'll be my new fool.

102
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,522
Thank you, Your Grace.

103
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:14,578
And you, My Lady, thank you.

104
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,873
<i>Beloved nephew.</i>

105
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,704
We looked for you on the battlefield.

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,042
You were nowhere to be found.

107
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,778
I've been here,
ruling the kingdoms.

108
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:37,946
What a fine job you've done.

109
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,310
Look at you.

110
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,319
More beautiful than ever.

111
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:47,523
And you! You...
You're going to be bigger than the hound,

112
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:50,025
but much better looking.

113
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,961
This one doesn't like me.

114
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,590
Can't imagine why.

115
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,880
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

116
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,640
Me, too, dear.

117
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,942
Death is so boring,

118
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:03,774
especially now with so much
excitement in the world.

119
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,666
My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

120
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:09,114
Her loss?

121
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,049
Her father was a confessed traitor.

122
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:12,684
But still her father.

123
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,720
Surely having so recently
lost your own beloved father

124
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,655
you can sympathize.

125
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,594
My father was a traitor.

126
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,916
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

127
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:28,110
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

128
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,790
Of course you are.

129
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,204
Well...

130
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,983
enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

131
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:39,195
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

132
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,578
but there is work to be done.

133
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,613
What work?

134
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,782
Why are you here?

135
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,887
The raven arrived from the Citadel

136
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,885
this morning, Your Grace.

137
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:57,960
The conclave has met, considered reports

138
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:00,837
from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms,

139
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,754
<i>and declared this great summer</i>

140
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,435
done at last.

141
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:09,435
The longest summer in living memory.

142
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:11,817
The peasants say,
a long summer means

143
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,609
<i>- an even longer winter.
- A common superstition.</i>

144
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,281
<i>We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.</i>

145
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,741
If it lasts any longer,

146
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:22,251
we'll have fewer peasants.

147
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:25,575
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

148
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,924
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

149
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:32,530
You command the City Watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

150
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:35,263
<i>I do, Your Grace.</i>

151
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,299
And are you not a Lord at my command?

152
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,836
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

153
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,348
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

154
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,475
They belong in the field,
not our capital.

155
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:48,311
Yes, Your Grace.

156
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:56,568
Don't get up.

157
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:01,189
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

158
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,993
War agrees with you.

159
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,394
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.

160
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,105
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,672
It's been a remarkable journey.

162
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,005
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

163
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,844
<i>I slept in a sky cell,</i>

164
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,210
I fought with the hill tribes...

165
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,475
so many adventures,

166
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,717
so much to be thankful for.

167
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:32,498
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

168
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:35,350
Yes. well I, do believe,
the Hand of the King,

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,351
is welcome at all small council meetings.

170
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,397
Our father is Hand of the King.

171
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:42,433
Yes, but in his absence...

172
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:51,842
<i>Your father has named Lord Tyrion</i>

173
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,759
to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights.

174
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:57,314
Out! All of you out!

175
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,827
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

176
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:06,877
If I were capable of tricking father,

177
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,864
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

178
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,283
You brought this on yourself.

179
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,365
- I've done nothing.
- Quite right... you did nothing

180
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:16,767
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

181
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,893
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

182
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:21,419
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

183
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:24,280
That bit of theater will haunt
our family for a generation.

184
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,479
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

185
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,397
Do you understand we're losing the war?

186
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,985
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

187
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,787
But I know people.

188
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:37,889
And I know that our enemies hate each other

189
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,825
almost as much as they hate us.

190
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:48,267
- Joffrey is King.
- Joffrey is King.

191
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,454
- You are here to advise him.
- I'm only here to advise him.

192
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,717
And if the King listens
to what I say, the king...

193
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,981
might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

194
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:01,276
How?

195
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,526
You love your children.
It's your one redeeming quality.

196
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,918
That and your cheekbones.

197
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,453
The Starks love their children as well.

198
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,302
- And we have two of them.
- One.

199
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:17,660
- One?
- Arya, little animal... she disappeared.

200
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,230
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?

201
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:25,677
We had three Starks to trade.

202
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:29,175
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

203
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,574
Father will be furious.

204
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,899
It must be odd for you...

205
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:39,049
to be the disappointing child.

206
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:50,395
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods
watch over your brother</i>

207
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,098
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

208
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,102
<i>The walls of my Holdfast
will not stand the winter.</i>

209
00:12:57,137 --> 00:13:01,006
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

210
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:03,408
and I'm afraid the masons today

211
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:07,019
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

212
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,898
When I was a boy,
I remember seeing them

213
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:14,217
<i>put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</i>

214
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,353
<i>Men worked back then.</i>

215
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:19,025
Today, my Holdfast looks like it was

216
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:21,558
built by drunk children.

217
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:26,103
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

218
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,241
<i>And the Gods forbid it rains.</i>

219
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:31,002
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

220
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:33,232
<i>Maintenance of a Holdfast</i>

221
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:36,108
generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

222
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,610
Generally, yes,

223
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,311
but I've sent all the young men off

224
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,247
to fight Robb Stark's war.

225
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:44,383
King Robb.
And it's not his war.

226
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,176
He didn't choose it.

227
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,669
Maybe not, My Lord,

228
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,921
but he called in his Banners and took the men.

229
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,055
<i>Joffrey killed my father,</i>

230
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,158
your liege lord.

231
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:56,660
Do you remember your vows, Ser?

232
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,697
Of course I remember!

233
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,665
We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord.

234
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,108
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

235
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,071
I...
I believe it will.

236
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:15,924
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

237
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,685
I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.

238
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,520
Nor did I.

239
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,782
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

240
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:31,545
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

241
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,934
<i>Lord Portan.</i>

242
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,027
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods
watch over your brother</i>

243
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:41,109
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

244
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:33,988
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

245
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:36,698
Makes all your pain go away.

246
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,987
Don't have any pain.

247
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,001
Lucky for you.

248
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,466
That way.

249
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,062
You've been having those dreams again.

250
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,744
<i>I don't dream.</i>

251
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,491
Everyone dreams.

252
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:54,191
I don't.

253
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:57,820
Heard some of the men talking about the comet.

254
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,552
<i>They say it's an omen.</i>

255
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,991
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the South.

256
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:04,501
Did they?

257
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,230
I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.

258
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:13,917
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

259
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,945
Heard a stableboy say it's the color of blood

260
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,474
to mark the death of your father.

261
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:26,547
The stars don't fall for men.

262
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:29,503
The red comet means one thing, boy.

263
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:32,019
Dragons.

264
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:36,176
The dragons are all dead.

265
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:39,038
They've been dead for centuries.

266
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,971
What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?

267
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,675
He said they ate meat.

268
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,159
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

269
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:33,525
My brother didn't know anything about dragons.

270
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:37,008
He didn't know anything about anything.

271
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,971
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

272
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,423
I remember.

273
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:19,928
I promised to protect them.

274
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:22,296
Promised them their enemies would die screaming.

275
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:24,832
How do I make starvation scream?

276
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,869
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

277
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:31,772
Does it ever end?

278
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,774
This is farther east than I've ever been.

279
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,342
But, yes, Khaleesi,

280
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:37,276
everything ends,
even the red waste.

281
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,471
And you're sure there's no other way?

282
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,216
If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen,

283
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,718
the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.

284
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,653
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

285
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,722
the first Khalasar we meet

286
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,290
will kill us and take your dragons.

287
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,993
No one will take my dragons.

288
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,528
They are too weak to fight,

289
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,744
as are your people.

290
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,269
You must be their strength.

291
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:04,343
As you are mine.

292
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:21,042
<b>Rakaro, Aggo, Kavarro.
Take our remaining horses.</b>

293
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:25,406
<b>You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.</b>

294
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,572
<b>What do we seek, Khaleesi?</b>

295
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:32,374
<b>Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.</b>

296
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,602
<b>Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.</b>

297
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:40,814
<b>Find how far the Red Waste extends before us,
and what lies on the other side.</b>

298
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:52,787
Rakharo...

299
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,034
<b>You are my last hope, blood of my blood.</b>

300
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,933
<b>I will not fail you, blood of my blood.</b>

301
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,297
You never have.

302
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:12,206
This is bad time to start.

303
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:10,266
You having a rough time of it?

304
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:12,028
Nothing's killed me yet.

305
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,423
- Your ass killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

306
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:18,788
I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

307
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:34,556
I was born in a place like this.

308
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:37,726
Later, I fell on hard times.

309
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:41,129
<i>Are those girls?</i>

310
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,964
<i>Craster's daughters.</i>

311
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,735
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

312
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:49,337
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

313
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:52,140
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

314
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:55,587
He don't like people messing with his wives.

315
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:58,714
He marries his daughters,

316
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,566
<i>and they give him more daughters.</i>

317
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:03,185
And on and on it goes.

318
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,678
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

319
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:09,409
All the other wildlings for a
hundred leagues have disappeared.

320
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:11,593
Craster's still here.

321
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,967
He must be doing something right.

322
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:17,972
What happens to the boys?

323
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:21,041
<i>- Hmm?
- He marries his daughters.</i>

324
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:24,041
What does he do with his sons?

325
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:28,340
He said he planned to stop here

326
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,246
on his way to the Frostfangs.

327
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,994
People make all sorts of plans.

328
00:22:32,004 --> 00:22:35,351
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

329
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:36,852
Haven't missed him.

330
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:39,622
Always treated me like scum.

331
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:43,526
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

332
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,562
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

333
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,631
We're not Southerners.

334
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,400
Who's this little girl?

335
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:54,671
You're prettier than half my daughters.

336
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:58,041
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

337
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,809
What's your name?

338
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:01,844
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

339
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:04,713
Listen to me, bastard.

340
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:08,717
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

341
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:12,621
But now you're in the North,
the real North.

342
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:14,967
The lad meant no harm.

343
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:19,125
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

344
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:23,165
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

345
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:26,536
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

346
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,697
You bring any of that good wine with you?

347
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:33,076
We did.

348
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,947
We passed through six villages on the way here.

349
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,440
All six were abandoned.

350
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:40,918
Where have all the wildlings gone?

351
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,196
I could tell you,
but I'm thirsty.

352
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,785
<i>There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.</i>

353
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:49,393
<i>- Bring it in here.
- Yes, commander.</i>

354
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,054
<i>You want to know where they've all gone?</i>

355
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:53,533
<i>North...</i>

356
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,211
<i>to join up with Mance Rayder...</i>

357
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:59,835
Your old friend.

358
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,505
He's no friend of mine.

359
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:05,672
He broke his vows,
betrayed his brothers.

360
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:06,897
Oh, aye.

361
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:10,081
But once he was just a poor black crow.

362
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,051
And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.

363
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,554
He's been calling himself that for years.

364
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:19,325
What's he king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?

365
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,762
That's a good-looking axe.

366
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,931
<i>Fresh forged?</i>

367
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:28,665
Give it here.

368
00:24:29,591 --> 00:24:31,671
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

369
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:32,856
Here.

370
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,792
That's some lovely steel.

371
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:44,284
You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?

372
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,119
Gathering an army.

373
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:48,388
<i>What I hear,
he's already got more men</i>

374
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,079
<i>than any of your southern kings.</i>

375
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,260
And where does he plan marching this army?

376
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:57,374
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

377
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:03,153
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

378
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:05,919
The cold winds are rising.

379
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,244
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.

380
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,025
Wife...

381
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:17,818
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

382
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,220
This is our place.

383
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:22,155
Our husband keeps us safe.

384
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:25,619
Better to live free than die a slave.

385
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:30,631
<i>Don't it make you jealous, old man,</i>

386
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,733
to see me with all these young wives

387
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:35,955
and you with no one to warm your bed?

388
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,005
We chose different paths.

389
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,992
Oh, aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

390
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:47,693
You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof,
I suppose, and...

391
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:49,582
eat me out of pigs.

392
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:51,518
A roof would be welcome.

393
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,086
It's been hard riding.

394
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,121
We've brought our own food and good steel for you.

395
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:02,370
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

396
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,664
he loses the hand.

397
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:10,302
And I see this one staring too long,

398
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:13,312
I might just gouge his eyes out.

399
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:16,216
Your roof, your rules.

400
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:31,620
Who am I?!

401
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,630
- Who am I?!
- Lord commander.

402
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:38,833
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

403
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,912
<i>Who are you?</i>

404
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,456
Your steward.

405
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:46,263
You want to lead one day?

406
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,600
Then learn how to follow.

407
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,700
<i>Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.</i>

408
00:27:13,402 --> 00:27:16,273
<i>We offer you these false Gods.</i>

409
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:20,222
Take them and cast your light upon us...

410
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:25,095
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

411
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,236
<i>For the night is dark and full of terrors.</i>

412
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,153
After the long summer,
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

413
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,409
The stars will bleed.

414
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:41,697
We need to stop her.

415
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:45,406
<i>The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.</i>

416
00:27:46,342 --> 00:27:49,142
<i>- Not now.
- And the dead shall rise in the North.</i>

417
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,150
All you men were named in the Light of the Seven!

418
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,493
Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers?

419
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:02,857
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

420
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,530
You smell of fear,

421
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,913
fear and piss and old bones.

422
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,190
Do you want to stop me?

423
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Stop me.

424
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:43,131
In the ancient books,
it's written that a warrior,

425
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:45,911
will draw a burning sword from the fire.

426
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,070
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

427
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,789
Stannis Baratheon,

428
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,860
warrior of light,

429
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,400
your sword awaits you.

430
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,840
<i>Lord, cast your light upon us!</i>

431
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,833
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

432
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,866
For the night is dark and full of terror.

433
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,920
This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.

434
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,650
Stannis is our king.

435
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,520
We follow where he leads,
even if we don't like the path.

436
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,550
King.

437
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:29,020
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

438
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,792
- I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
- As do I,

439
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,333
but loyal service means telling hard truths.

440
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,680
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

441
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:44,183
but he trusts you, Davos.

442
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,279
If you tell him the truth...

443
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,150
What's the truth?

444
00:31:04,002 --> 00:31:07,194
"And I declare upon the honor of my house
that my beloved brother Robert left..."

445
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,223
He wasn't my beloved brother.

446
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:10,842
I didn't love him.

447
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,943
- He didn't love me.
- A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

448
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:16,147
A lie. Take it out.

449
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:20,900
"...that my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs,

450
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,271
the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella,

451
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:26,134
being born of incest between Cersei Lannister

452
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,632
and her brother Jaime Lannister.
By right of birth..."

453
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:32,714
Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
Call him what he is.

454
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:36,953
"And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

455
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:39,872
By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

456
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:43,037
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

457
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,406
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

458
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,342
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

459
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,711
By right of birth and blood,

460
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:53,448
I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

461
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,992
Let all true men declare their loyalty."

462
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:58,091
When Eddard Stark learned the truth,
he told only me.

463
00:31:58,121 --> 00:31:59,954
I'll not make the same mistake.

464
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:02,595
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the Realm,

465
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,492
from the Arbor to the Wall.

466
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:07,078
The time has come to choose.

467
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,075
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

468
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,567
Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy.

469
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,640
If, for the time being, you could
make peace with your brother.

470
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,943
I'll not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

471
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,811
Well, many have already declared for him.

472
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:20,728
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

473
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:24,250
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

474
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,848
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

475
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:29,351
And how many ships has
the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

476
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:31,954
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

477
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:34,021
but we do if we're going to war.

478
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:36,638
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

479
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:38,832
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.

480
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:42,336
I've always served thieves according to
their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.

481
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:45,367
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark,
they're all thieves.

482
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:47,870
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

483
00:32:48,817 --> 00:32:51,799
I owe you an apology, my King.

484
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,577
My duty is to serve.

485
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:58,346
You have chosen the new God over the old Gods.

486
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:02,217
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

487
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,619
Shall we drink together?

488
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:06,368
Don't.

489
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:10,962
A cup of wine to honor the one true God.

490
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:00,813
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

491
00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:04,083
but the fire burns them all away.

492
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,640
<i>Your Grace.</i>

493
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:40,899
King in the North.

494
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:47,495
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

495
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,674
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

496
00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:54,235
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

497
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,469
Is that it?

498
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:58,106
I've never seen you with a girl.

499
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,643
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

500
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:04,013
your father would know within a fortnight

501
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:08,217
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message:

502
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:11,820
"Release my son and you'll be rich
beyond your dreams.

503
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:15,391
Refuse and your house will be destroyed,
root and stem."

504
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:20,062
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

505
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:22,320
I trust them with my life,

506
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:25,411
just not with yours.

507
00:35:25,574 --> 00:35:27,042
Smart boy.

508
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:29,172
What's wrong?

509
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:31,785
Don't like being called "boy"?

510
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:34,038
Insulted?

511
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:44,000
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

512
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:48,723
You've been defeated by a boy.

513
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:51,558
You're held captive by a boy.

514
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:56,263
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

515
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:07,394
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

516
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:11,881
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king,

517
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:14,101
nor a true Baratheon.

518
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:16,717
He's your bastard son.

519
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:19,327
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

520
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,391
How convenient for him.

521
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:25,478
My father learned the truth.

522
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,397
That's why you had him executed.

523
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,804
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

524
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:33,404
Your son killed him so the world
wouldn't learn who fathered him.

525
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:34,811
And you...

526
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:39,898
You pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

527
00:36:44,558 --> 00:36:46,181
You have proof?

528
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,227
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

529
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:54,098
I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.

530
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,164
You think my father's going to negotiate with you?

531
00:36:57,713 --> 00:36:59,600
You don't know him very well.

532
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,790
No,

533
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:03,563
but he's starting to know me.

534
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:07,673
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

535
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:11,546
It's better than three defeats.

536
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:41,914
<i>This city stinks...</i>

537
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:46,781
Like dead bodies.

538
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:48,949
A bit corpsey, yes.

539
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,955
And shit.

540
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,386
I thought you wanted to come here.

541
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,116
I love it.

542
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,655
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

543
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:05,605
And cum and garlic and rum.

544
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:08,486
You can smell cum from the balcony?

545
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:11,828
I love the stink.
I love the noise.

546
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:15,173
Cities make me want to fuck.

547
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,580
And so did the country.

548
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:22,483
This is where I belong.

549
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,928
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

550
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:26,992
No one can know you're here.

551
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,436
No one will know.

552
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,444
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

553
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,493
They're all liars...
Good liars, bad liars,

554
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,962
one or two great liars.

555
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:37,670
What about you?

556
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,722
Me? I'm not from here.
I'm a slave to the truth.

557
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:43,502
Truth?

558
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:48,474
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

559
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:50,509
Why do you think I am so little?

560
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:54,874
I'm being crushed beneath the
weight of all that truth.

561
00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:02,053
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

562
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:05,924
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

563
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:11,197
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

564
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,123
Lord Baelish.

565
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:25,838
Your Grace.

566
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:28,128
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

567
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,828
Of course, Your Grace.

568
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:32,100
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

569
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,880
we can't seem to locate her.

570
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,579
If she's escaped the capital,

571
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:38,720
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

572
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,605
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

573
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:42,635
Curious.

574
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:46,894
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,
the girl has some value.

575
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:49,761
Whoever finds her, well, you know what
they say about Lannisters and debts.

576
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,791
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

577
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:57,017
He'll have an answer for you.
Whether you believe it...

578
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:00,156
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

579
00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:02,140
Who knows what they want?

580
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:04,822
A mockingbird.

581
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,676
You created your own sigil, didn't you?

582
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:08,706
Yes.

583
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,844
Appropriate...

584
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:13,653
for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.

585
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:15,233
I'm glad you like it.

586
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,925
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

587
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,421
Others have to find their own way.

588
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,925
I heard a song once,

589
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,355
about a boy of modest means,

590
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:31,658
who found his way into the
home of a very prominent family.

591
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:34,191
He loved the eldest daughter.

592
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:36,287
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

593
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:41,610
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

594
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,194
Sometimes, I've heard,

595
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:46,524
even brothers and sisters
develop certain affections.

596
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:49,332
And when these affections become common knowledge,

597
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:50,362
well,

598
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:53,197
that is an awkward situation indeed,

599
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:55,467
especially in a prominent family.

600
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:58,968
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

601
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,173
I've found.

602
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:02,948
And which truth is that?

603
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,059
Knowledge

604
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,155
is power.

605
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:10,549
Seize him.

606
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:15,288
Cut his throat.

607
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:16,971
Stop.

608
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Wait.

609
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,585
I've changed my mind.
Let him go.

610
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:25,891
Step back three paces.

611
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:28,747
Turn around.

612
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:31,585
Close your eyes.

613
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:37,009
Power

614
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:38,332
is power.

615
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:43,751
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

616
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:45,890
to locate the Stark girl for me.

617
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:47,794
I would very much appreciate it.

618
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:00,949
<i>You're Ser Alton Lannister?</i>

619
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:03,454
I am, Your Grace.

620
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:05,595
I offer your cousins peace,

621
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,512
if they meet my terms.

622
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,542
First,

623
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:11,819
your family must release my sisters.

624
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:15,273
Second, my father's bones must be returned to us

625
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:19,543
so he may rest beside his brother and
sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

626
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:24,278
And the remains of all those who died in
his service must also be returned.

627
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:27,396
Their families can honor
them with proper funerals.

628
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:29,213
An honorable request, Your Grace.

629
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:30,243
Third...

630
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:35,754
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

631
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:41,452
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

632
00:42:41,844 --> 00:42:43,464
The King in the North.

633
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,036
King in the North.

634
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,165
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

635
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,391
If he disregards this command,

636
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,712
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

637
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:57,168
only...

638
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,113
I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.

639
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:01,865
These are...
Your Grace...

640
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:05,023
These are...
These are my terms.

641
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,266
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

642
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:10,446
If not...

643
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:14,995
I will litter the south with Lannister dead.

644
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,570
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

645
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,860
Is he?

646
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:22,924
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

647
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,264
That will be all for tonight.

648
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:43,478
A word, Your Grace?

649
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:48,123
You don't have to call me
"Your Grace" when no one's around.

650
00:43:48,153 --> 00:43:49,610
It's not so bad,

651
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:51,142
once you get used to it.

652
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,888
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

653
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:56,141
The Lannisters are going to reject
your terms, you know?

654
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:57,671
Of course they are.

655
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,580
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

656
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,241
but we won't beat them until
you take King's Landing.

657
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:08,266
And we can't take King's Landing without ships.

658
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:11,267
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

659
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:13,257
Men who fought my father.

660
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:17,361
Men who fought King Robert to free
themselves from the yoke of the South,

661
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,500
just like you're doing now.

662
00:44:20,813 --> 00:44:23,163
I'm his only living son.

663
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:24,949
He'll listen to me.

664
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,899
I know he will.

665
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:31,509
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

666
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:36,076
But your father raised me to be an honorable man.

667
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:39,304
We can avenge him together.

668
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,079
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

669
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:46,419
I need his ships.
They say he has 200.

670
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:50,425
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

671
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:53,802
- Shall we rally them to fight for us?
- I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

672
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:57,550
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

673
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:01,151
Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.

674
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:02,181
Yes.

675
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:05,132
And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.

676
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:06,880
Before me, it was father.

677
00:45:07,419 --> 00:45:09,550
You married one rebel and mothered another.

678
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,254
I mothered more than just rebels,

679
00:45:12,288 --> 00:45:14,658
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

680
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:16,749
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,

681
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:18,788
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

682
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:21,536
You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands?

683
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:23,195
And Arya...

684
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:26,244
I haven't heard a word about Arya.

685
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:28,916
What are we fighting for if not for them?

686
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:31,695
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

687
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:49,096
It's time for me to go home.

688
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,152
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

689
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:57,055
You can't go to Winterfell.

690
00:45:58,182 --> 00:45:59,282
I beg your pardon?

691
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:02,319
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys,

692
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,246
because tomorrow,

693
00:46:04,827 --> 00:46:07,545
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

694
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:09,088
Why in the name of all the Gods...

695
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:12,401
Because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

696
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:17,168
He's rallied an army of 100,000.
You know him. You know his family.

697
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:19,417
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.

698
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:20,864
You have a hundred other lords...

699
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:23,594
Which of these lords do I trust more than you?

700
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:27,886
If Renly sides with us,

701
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:30,466
we'll outnumber them two to one.

702
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,404
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

703
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:35,282
We'll get the girls back.

704
00:46:36,248 --> 00:46:37,898
Then we'll all go home...

705
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,150
For good.

706
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:50,091
I will ride at first light.

707
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:02,047
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

708
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:09,267
You've done so well.

709
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:12,125
Your father would be...

710
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,290
Proud.

711
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:25,302
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.

712
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:29,731
There's a king in every corner now.

713
00:47:42,657 --> 00:47:44,375
What is all this?

714
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:47,393
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

715
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:50,535
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

716
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:52,996
That is a seat for a conqueror.

717
00:47:53,026 --> 00:47:56,891
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

718
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,956
We can't find Arya Stark.

719
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,228
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

720
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:03,324
Perhaps.
But if not, we need her.

721
00:48:03,432 --> 00:48:05,764
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

722
00:48:05,794 --> 00:48:08,121
I think they might.
They're weak.

723
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:10,534
They put too much value on their women.

724
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:14,064
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

725
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:16,287
Send out as many men as we can.

726
00:48:16,317 --> 00:48:19,687
- I'm sure if you asked grandfather...
- The King does not ask...

727
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:21,509
He commands.

728
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:24,725
And my grandfather's
stupidity in the field of battle

729
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:27,711
is the reason Robb Stark has
Uncle Jaime in the first place.

730
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,821
His life is in danger.

731
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,972
We're at war.

732
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:34,481
All our lives are in danger.

733
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:41,406
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

734
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:43,271
And you.

735
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,045
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

736
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:50,400
It's not a claim.
The throne is mine.

737
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,678
Of course it is.

738
00:48:55,674 --> 00:48:59,001
- No one believes this foul gossip.
- Someone believes it.

739
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,939
Father had other children?

740
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:05,927
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

741
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:10,200
What are you asking?

742
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:14,031
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

743
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:17,154
How many bastards does he have running...

744
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,529
What you just did...

745
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,714
Is punishable by death.

746
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:40,873
You will never do it again.

747
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,179
Never.

748
00:49:49,992 --> 00:49:51,499
That will be all, Mother.

749
00:49:58,522 --> 00:50:00,559
No, no, no, no.

750
00:50:00,737 --> 00:50:03,420
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?

751
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,368
Ease into it.

752
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:07,601
Slowly, with passion.

753
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,324
Oh, yeah.

754
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,693
Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.

755
00:50:16,045 --> 00:50:18,073
Both of you are working tonight.

756
00:50:22,657 --> 00:50:24,300
We do things differently here, Daisy.

757
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,328
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

758
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,837
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

759
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:34,966
Our establishment doesn't cater
to ploughmen and goat herders.

760
00:50:35,697 --> 00:50:36,942
Lord Olsen.

761
00:50:37,822 --> 00:50:39,480
Taste is everything here.

762
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,473
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

763
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:44,329
Don't call him Littlefinger.
He doesn't like it.

764
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,417
Lord Baelish.

765
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:57,257
She pretends she doesn't speak the common
tongue so that people will think she's exotic.

766
00:50:57,614 --> 00:51:00,752
She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

767
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:02,327
She's beautiful.

768
00:51:03,017 --> 00:51:05,187
She's a dumb slut, really, but...

769
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:07,196
A lid for every pot.

770
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:13,370
Lord Commander.

771
00:51:13,932 --> 00:51:16,343
Good to see you...
Again.

772
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,547
You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

773
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,793
the King's Master of Coin...

774
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:40,407
Coin which goes in many pockets.

775
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:42,611
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

776
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,489
Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.

777
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:06,050
No, you can't.
No! Please!

778
00:52:07,501 --> 00:52:09,664
No! Not my Barra!

779
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,608
Please. Please.

780
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:13,522
Enough. Get it done.

781
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:15,531
- Kill the bastard.
- No, no!

782
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:16,589
Please.

783
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,081
Give it here.

784
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:19,965
No, please.

785
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:32,452
<i>Spread out.
Search every house.</i>

786
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,788
<i>Every room.
Look in every room.</i>

787
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:01,766
Gendry!
His name is Gendry.

788
00:53:01,993 --> 00:53:03,522
Where is the bastard?

789
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,801
The Night's Watch!
Please, stop!

790
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:07,969
Where?

791
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:10,923
They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north.

792
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:14,302
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.

793
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,443
<i>He made it himself.</i>

794
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:17,872
Find him.
