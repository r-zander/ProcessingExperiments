3
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:08,522
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,117
I will, Your Grace.

5
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:12,408
Did you see my brother when you
were the Starks' guest?

6
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:13,696
I did.

7
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:15,960
Tell him he's not
been forgotten.

8
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:23,958
- I'll do it.
- Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it.

9
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,769
Be quick about it.

10
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:30,566
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

11
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:32,419
All of you should do
as he commands.

12
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,783
Betray me and you will
wish you hadn't.

13
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:36,469
<i>All hail the king.</i>

14
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,403
Who threw that?

15
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,224
Get back!

16
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,970
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

17
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,712
Your brothers desert you?

18
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:55,325
- We'll stop here.
- Think they're out looking for you?

19
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:56,583
Yes.

20
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:02,464
What might this be?
Let's go.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,744
Amory Lorch.
Now!

22
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:07,842
A man will do
what must be done.

23
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:12,281
<i>Guard!</i>

24
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:15,447
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

25
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,832
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

26
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:25,505
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth

27
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,340
with no regrets.

28
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:33,176
Where are they?
Where are my dragons?!

33

A cripple?

34
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,065
You let a cripple escape?

35
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:51,770
<i>The boy can't walk,</i>

36
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:54,037
but somehow
he slipped past you?

37
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:56,372
The giant must have took him.

38
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,271
The giant?

39
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,258
Hodor?

40
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,811
Oh, well, that's all right, then.

41
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,824
You let a halfwit
escape with a cripple.

42
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,313
And Rickon, too?
The little one?

43
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:14,613
Gone along with
the wildling woman,

44
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:17,659
the one you were fucking.

45
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:40,881
Right, get the horses
and the hounds.

46
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,044
Come on, find the scent.

47
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,504
Come on,
where they going?

48
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:02,932
Halt!

49
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,250
Enjoying
your first hunt?

50
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,361
So far, hunting seems very similar
to riding, My Lord.

51
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,283
With hunting,
there's blood at the end.

52
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,697
They're little boys.

53
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,563
I was a little boy
when I was torn away from

54
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:19,452
my home and brought here.

55
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:20,963
So I kept my word.

56
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:23,022
I never ran away.

57
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,534
If I find them soon enough,
I won't hurt them.

58
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,230
Well, I'll hurt them,
but I won't kill them.

59
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:33,300
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

60
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,099
They have no value
to me missing.

61
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,532
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

62
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,739
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

63
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,739
<i>She'll get here long before they do.</i>

64
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:45,481
And Ned Stark always said

65
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,627
500 men could hold
Winterfell against 10,000.

66
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,645
<i>We have a scent!</i>

67
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:53,051
The hounds have the scent.

68
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:56,289
Come, Maester,
don't look so grim.

69
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,091
It's all just a game.

70
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,286
We should have took more food.

71
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,124
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

72
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:20,925
Those people all love you. They would
have given you whatever you needed.

73
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:23,150
And if Theon found out,
he'd hang them.

74
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,912
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

75
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:30,271
We've been walking
since before sunrise.

76
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:32,663
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

77
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,928
- Even you, sweet giant.
-  Hodor.

78
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,440
Wait, I know that farm.

79
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,569
<i>I sent those two</i>
<i>Winterfell orphans there.</i>

80
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,663
Jack and Billy.
They'll give us some food.

81
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,212
We can't risk it.

82
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,133
If Theon tracks us here,
he'll torture them

83
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,950
until he finds out
where we are.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,355
Billy climbs a tree
better than anyone.

85
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,581
You've never seen me
climb a tree, little man.

86
00:06:57,788 --> 00:06:59,851
<i>They'll be after us</i>
<i>with hounds.</i>

87
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,453
<i>We got a good start</i>
<i>on them,</i>

88
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,551
but we can't outrun
hounds forever.

89
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,051
Did you pull a knife
on me in the night?

90
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,761
What's the matter?

91
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:47,837
Can't be the first time you pressed
your bone against a woman's ass.

92
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:50,895
Let's move.

93
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,443
Oh, it is the first time.

94
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,401
How old are you, boy?

95
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:05,483
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

96
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:10,088
You're a boy who's
never been with a girl.

97
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:17,404
Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone never gets--

98
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,720
Don't call them that.

99
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,697
What, stones?

100
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:24,821
Or bone?

101
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,522
Neither.

102
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,866
Both.

103
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:32,917
Move!

104
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,170
I heard they get
all swollen

105
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,309
and bruised if you
don't use them.

106
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,438
Of course, maybe that's
just what the lads say

107
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,899
when they want me
feeling sorry for them.

108
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,628
As if I'd feel
sorry for them.

109
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,232
Are there no girl crows?

110
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,668
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

111
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,769
So the lads just do it
with each other?

112
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:00,027
No.

113
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:02,833
- Never?
- Never.

114
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:05,183
We swore an oath.

115
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:08,513
You have sheep
at the Wall?

116
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:12,241
With your hands, then?

117
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:15,545
No wonder
you're all so miserable.

118
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,236
Would you please shut up?

119
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:19,116
Would you please shut up?

120
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:22,544
You think you're
better than me, crow.

121
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,379
- I'm a free woman--
- You're a free woman?

122
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,549
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

123
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,585
If you're my prisoner,
you're not a free woman.

124
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,629
That's what
"prisoner" means.

125
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,706
And you think you're free?

126
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,448
You swore
some stupid oath

127
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,006
and now you can never
touch a girl.

128
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:40,191
It was my choice
to say the words.

129
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,306
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

130
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,937
But you chose
never to touch them.

131
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,840
That's the price you pay if you want
to be a man of the Night's Watch.

132
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:49,049
So instead of getting
naked with a girl,

133
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:52,492
- you'd prefer to invade our lands--
- Invade your lands?

134
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,300
Wildlings raid
our lands all the time.

135
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,120
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

136
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,028
They're not your lands!

137
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:01,240
We've been here
the whole time.

138
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,395
You lot came along
and just put up a big wall

139
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:05,074
and said it was yours.

140
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,427
My father was Ned Stark.

141
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,432
I have the blood
of the First Men.

142
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,982
My ancestors lived here,
same as yours.

143
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,420
So why are you
fighting us?

144
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,550
Go on.

145
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,962
<i>Now I want you to tell me
what happened.</i>

146
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,785
<i>Come on, this way.</i>

147
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:50,022
<i>Come on, speak up. Speak up.</i>

148
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,528
Wolfsbane...

149
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,282
a rare substance.

150
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:02,552
This is no common assassin.

151
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,968
We hanged 20 men last night.

152
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,020
I don't care if you hanged 100.

153
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:11,413
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

154
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:15,142
We think it was an infiltrator
from the Brotherhood Without Banners.

155
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,548
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

156
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:23,259
We can't allow rebels behind our lines
to harass us with impunity.

157
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:27,054
We look like fools and they look like heroes.
That's how kings fall.

158
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,257
I want them dead, every one.

159
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,092
Killing them isn't the problem.

160
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:32,928
It's finding them.

161
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:34,869
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

162
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,913
I always thought you had
a talent for violence.

163
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:40,096
Burn the villages, burn the farms.

164
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:44,754
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

165
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:49,453
Is that mutton?

166
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:51,420
Yes, My Lord.

167
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:53,032
Don't like mutton.

168
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,868
I'll bring something else.

169
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,089
Leave it.

170
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:00,687
Are you hungry?

171
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,197
- No.
- Of course you are.

172
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,069
Eat.

173
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,965
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

174
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,515
It's bad manners to refuse
a Lord's offer.

175
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:13,496
Sit.

176
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,721
Eat.

177
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,788
You're small for your age.

178
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,711
I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.

179
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:26,937
I eat a lot.

180
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:28,905
I just don't grow.

181
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,768
This will be my last war,

182
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,009
win or lose.

183
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,253
Have you ever lost before?

184
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:47,074
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

185
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,261
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

186
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,102
The "War of Five Kings" they're calling it.

187
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,852
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

188
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,747
Do you know what legacy means?

189
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,305
It's what you pass down to your children

190
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:14,899
and your children's children.

191
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,297
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

192
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:26,732
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

193
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,157
The greatest fortress ever built...

194
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,985
the tallest towers, the strongest walls.

195
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:36,554
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

196
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:39,626
35. Can you imagine?

197
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:42,532
Look at it now...

198
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,535
a blasted ruin.

199
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,297
Do you know what happened?

200
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:49,914
Dragons?

201
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,867
Yes...

202
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:53,939
Dragons happened.

203
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:02,018
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

204
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:07,294
A million men could have
marched on these walls

205
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,813
and a million men would
have been repelled.

206
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:13,209
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire...

207
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:19,212
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

208
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:22,403
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

209
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:26,444
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

210
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,568
300 years after his death.

211
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,979
Aegon and his sisters.

212
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,329
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

213
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,942
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

214
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,345
Correct.

215
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,162
A student of history, are you?

216
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,364
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

217
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:47,732
Visenya rode Vhagar.

218
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,272
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

219
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:54,672
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

220
00:14:56,477 --> 00:15:00,151
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

221
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,922
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

222
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:08,596
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

223
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,735
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

224
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,604
- Most girls are idiots.
- Ha!

225
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,804
You remind me of my daughter.

226
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:23,723
Where did you learn all this stuff
about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword?

227
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,189
From my father.

228
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:30,804
He was a well-read stonemason.

229
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:35,845
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

230
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,890
Have you met many stonemasons, My Lord?

231
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:43,356
Careful now, girl.

232
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,393
I enjoy you, but be careful.

233
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,217
Take that back to the kitchen.

234
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:50,866
Eat what you want.

235
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:55,284
And, girl.

236
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:58,939
M'lord.

237
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,005
Lowborn girls say "M'lord,"

238
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:05,568
not "My Lord."

239
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:10,271
If you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

240
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,425
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, My Lord.

241
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,747
She taught me how to speak proper...

242
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,076
properly.

243
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,998
You're too smart for your own good.

244
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,659
Has anyone told you that?

245
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,207
Yes.

246
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:29,081
Go on.

247
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:42,703
I beg pardon, Ser.

248
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,677
I should have come to you after

249
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,892
to thank you for saving me.

250
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,416
You were so brave.

251
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,457
Brave?

252
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,314
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

253
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,086
Does it give you joy to scare people?

254
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,854
No. It gives me joy to kill people.

255
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:06,238
Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard
Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.

256
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:09,132
It was his duty. He never liked it.

257
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,102
Is that what he told you?

258
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:12,902
He lied.

259
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,411
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

260
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,361
Why are you always so hateful?

261
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:23,105
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

262
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:27,311
and I'm all that stands between
you and your beloved king.

263
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:39,562
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

264
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,199
You are one of the Thirteen.

265
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,316
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

266
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,352
They mean nothing to me on their own.

267
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:46,550
Nothing?

268
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:49,448
They're more valuable than
anything in the world.

269
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,188
Shall we look inside my vault and see
what selling your dragons

270
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:54,452
would buy me I cannot buy already?

271
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,241
We will get them back.

272
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,938
There is no we,

273
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,791
so why would you help me get them back?

274
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:04,289
I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.

275
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,515
A man is what others say
he is and no more.

276
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,330
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

277
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,498
my word is worth nothing.

278
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:15,401
I cannot let this thing
happen to you under my roof.

279
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:17,415
But it did happen under your roof.

280
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,970
Khaleesi...

281
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,177
many times in my life I have been...

282
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,164
I don't care where you've been.

283
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:49,666
You think we're savages because
we don't live in stone castles.

284
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:53,898
We can't make steel as good
as yours, it's true, but...

285
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,481
We're free.

286
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,917
If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down
as man and woman,

287
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:02,190
we'd shove a spear up his ass.

288
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,090
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

289
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
No.

290
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:10,557
No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

291
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:13,565
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

292
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:15,646
He was a crow, same as you,

293
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:18,194
but he wanted to be free.

294
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,927
You could be free, too.

295
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:26,143
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

296
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,284
Wake up when you want to wake up.

297
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:32,913
I could show you the streams
to fish, the woods to hunt.

298
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:37,149
Build yourself a cabin and find
a woman to lie with in the night.

299
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:39,993
You're a pretty lad.

300
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:44,831
The girls would claw each other's
eyes out to get naked with you.

301
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,660
Walk.

302
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,252
I could teach you how to do it.

303
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,096
I know how to do it.

304
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:00,038
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

305
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,136
And what did she say?

306
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,654
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

307
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:35,373
And what then?

308
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,761
She, uh...

309
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:45,262
If every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,

310
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,396
we'd all hang.

311
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:52,254
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

312
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:56,727
You've acted with honor.
I thank you for it.

313
00:20:56,963 --> 00:21:00,003
Lord Karstark, see that
Ser Alton's pen is clean.

314
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,533
And give him a hot supper.

315
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:04,196
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

316
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:06,873
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

317
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:08,942
Too many prisoners.

318
00:21:09,494 --> 00:21:11,712
Is there room for Ser Alton?

319
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,254
Does he need to lie down?

320
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:19,221
Have the men build him a new pen.

321
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,266
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

322
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,218
Have your boy watch over them.

323
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,287
Torrhen.

324
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,018
That will be all.

325
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,256
Your Grace.

326
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,662
A minute of your time?

327
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,180
I've been treating your wounded men.

328
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:59,256
And my enemies as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

329
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,111
They're not my enemies.

330
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,466
That's what I tell my bannermen.

331
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,070
I've already run through the
supplies I brought with me.

332
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,578
Some are easily replaced...
egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

333
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:12,874
But some are not.

334
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:15,417
I need silk for stitching.

335
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:20,231
I need fennel root
for those with fever, willow bark.

336
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:22,395
Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

337
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,404
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

338
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,551
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

339
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:33,572
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

340
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:37,399
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

341
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,901
Continue, My Lady.

342
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:46,390
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

343
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Yes.

344
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:51,335
The Crag will have a Maester
and he will have what I need.

345
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,162
I expect he will.

346
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:55,160
If I could write a list...

347
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,098
come with me to the Crag.

348
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:03,084
- I don't think that will be...
- Let the Maester show you his stores.

349
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:06,194
I want the wounded men
to be treated well...

350
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:08,909
all the wounded men.

351
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,546
<i>Children, come inside, quick.</i>

352
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,276
<i>Hurry up!</i>

353
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,947
<i>Can't find anything, Ser.</i>

354
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,391
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

355
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:30,557
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

356
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,707
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, My Lord.

357
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:38,681
I'm looking at spending the rest of life
being treated like a fool and a eunuch

358
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:39,982
by my own people.

359
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:43,505
Ask yourself, "Is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?"

360
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:47,711
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

361
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:51,443
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

362
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,582
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

363
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:58,663
It's better to be cruel than weak.

364
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:00,135
Prince Theon.

365
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,607
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

366
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:04,670
The Stark boys. Where are they?

367
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:06,994
I don't know. I seen no one.
Oh!

368
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,124
Think harder.

369
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:11,908
I swear, m'lord,

370
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,811
I don't know.

371
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,456
My Lord,

372
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:16,623
over here.

373
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,508
I think I've found what
we're looking for.

374
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,176
Send the old man home.

375
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:41,339
Go back to Winterfell.

376
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:43,525
Take him back.

377
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:47,693
Theon, don't do this.

378
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:07,951
You came back.

379
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:09,904
As soon as I heard.

380
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,945
Do you know anything?

381
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,219
Irri is dead.

382
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,040
I know.

383
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,528
- She was a good...
- she's dead.

384
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:23,608
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

385
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:26,602
Doreah?

386
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:28,725
We can't find her.

387
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,472
She must be dead, too.

388
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:36,579
I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

389
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,547
I should have been here.

390
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:41,910
You went to find me a ship.

391
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,893
My place is by your side.

392
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:46,725
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

393
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:48,324
These people?

394
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,076
They are not to be trusted.

395
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,500
And who is to be trusted?

396
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:54,699
Who are my people?

397
00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:56,758
The Targaryens?

398
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:58,869
I only knew one... my brother,

399
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:02,660
and he would have let 1,000 men rape me
if it had got him the crown.

400
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:04,810
The Dothraki?

401
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,743
Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

402
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:10,683
Your people are in Westeros.

403
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:13,022
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

404
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,169
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

405
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:17,544
They'll pray for my return?

406
00:26:17,574 --> 00:26:20,678
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

407
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,078
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

408
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,344
You are not your brother.

409
00:26:25,678 --> 00:26:27,715
Trust me, Khaleesi.

410
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:29,561
There it is...

411
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,806
"trust me."

412
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,091
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

413
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:37,076
Only you?

414
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,314
I don't need trust any longer.

415
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:46,053
I don't want it and
I don't have room for it.

416
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:50,705
- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.

417
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,181
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

418
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,103
No one can survive
in this world without help.

419
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,318
No one.

420
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,961
Let me help you, please.

421
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:08,693
Tell me how.

422
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,742
Find my dragons.

423
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,605
How long till we get back to your crows?

424
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:26,021
We're close.

425
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:27,697
What, a day?

426
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:29,412
A half-day?

427
00:27:33,788 --> 00:27:35,860
You don't know, do you?

428
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:39,142
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

429
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:43,390
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

430
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,512
Nothing happened between you and me.

431
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:48,709
"I swear it, old master king crow, Ser,

432
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:51,426
we were only close together for warmth.

433
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,097
And then I felt it,

434
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,803
right up against me backside like a club.

435
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:58,082
I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

436
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,868
And before I knew what
was where, his... his...

437
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:04,815
well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

438
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:08,343
And I didn't want to want it,
but, oh, I did!

439
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,811
And he spread me legs and... ruined.

440
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:13,315
The shame of it.

441
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,779
Now I can never marry
a perfumed lord.

442
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,266
What will me poor savage father say?"

443
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:19,701
Turn back around.

444
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,637
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

445
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:22,854
'Turn back around.'"

446
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:27,004
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

447
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:29,945
since it's going to be your
word against mine,

448
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,375
and since you can't talk
about it without blushing,

449
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,399
we may as well just.

450
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:38,974
What, right here in the muck?

451
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:41,054
I'll keep you warm enough.

452
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,334
Are you that afraid of it?

453
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:49,302
- That's enough.
- Oh, it's nice

454
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:52,683
and wet and warm.

455
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,056
Enough

456
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,194
It don't have teeth.

457
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:06,525
All right!

458
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:08,973
All right.

459
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:13,073
Gods, you're dull.

460
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,704
Should have took me while
you had the chance.

461
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,294
No!

462
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:03,952
no!

463
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:24,547
No!

464
00:30:24,651 --> 00:30:25,651
Oh, no.

465
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:43,425
It's all right.

466
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:45,904
- Give me that.
- If the queen sees

467
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:48,738
I can have Joffrey's children now...

468
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,261
Help me flip it over.

469
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,945
- Where are you going?
- To tell her Grace.

470
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:13,776
You'll say nothing to anyone.

471
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,625
Do you understand?

472
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:39,623
Your mother might have prepared you.

473
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:42,119
You flowered, my dear. No more.

474
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:45,469
My mother told me, but I
thought it would be different.

475
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:46,599
In what way?

476
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:50,062
I thought it would be less...

477
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,148
less messy.

478
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:55,596
Wait until you bear the child.

479
00:31:57,989 --> 00:32:01,039
You're a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?

480
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:04,382
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

481
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,934
A prospect that once delighted you...

482
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:10,650
bringing little princes
and princesses into the world,

483
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,330
the greatest honor for a queen.

484
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:20,018
Joffrey has always been difficult.

485
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:24,927
Even his birth, I labored a day and a half
to bring him into this world.

486
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:27,007
You cannot imagine the pain.

487
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:31,684
I screamed so loudly, I was sure
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

488
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:33,539
His Grace was not with you?

489
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,169
Robert was hunting.

490
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:37,415
That was his custom.

491
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:42,583
Whenever my time was near,

492
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:46,098
my royal husband would flee
to the trees with his

493
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:49,442
huntsmen and his hounds.

494
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:54,996
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

495
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,280
and I would present him with a baby.

496
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,505
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

497
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:04,311
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives,

498
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,241
and I had my brother.

499
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:10,023
When they told Jaime he wasn't
allowed in the birthing room,

500
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:15,546
he smiled and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

501
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:21,333
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

502
00:33:23,513 --> 00:33:25,663
You may never love the king,

503
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,692
but you will love his children.

504
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,464
I love his Grace with all my heart.

505
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:34,015
That's so very touching to hear.

506
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,823
Permit me to share some
womanly wisdom with you

507
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,953
on this very special day.

508
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,397
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

509
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:51,077
You'll do things for them that
you know you shouldn't do.

510
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:56,003
You'll act the fool to make them
happy, to keep them safe.

511
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,252
Love no one but your children.

512
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,338
On that front, a mother has no choice.

513
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:07,615
But... shouldn't I love Joffrey,
Your Grace?

514
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:12,246
You can try,

515
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:15,475
little dove.

516
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:33,887
Who did you say your mother was again?

517
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:35,971
Cinda Lannister.

518
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:38,075
Is she the fat one?

519
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,480
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than she...

520
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,242
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

521
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:46,805
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

522
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,813
I... I squired for you once, you know?

523
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:54,555
When?

524
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:58,086
The tournament the day of
Willem Frey's wedding.

525
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,320
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

526
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,350
You did.

527
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:06,493
Your squire had gotten
so drunk the night before that he...

528
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:09,339
He threw up on his horse
on the way to the tourney grounds.

529
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:10,719
What was his name?

530
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:12,464
Bryan.

531
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,792
Poor lad.

532
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:18,459
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

533
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:21,908
I remember you.

534
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:25,565
You had never squired for anyone before.

535
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:27,349
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.

536
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:30,079
"Let me, My Lord. Let me."

537
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:32,889
My father was furious,

538
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,150
afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of

539
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,413
<i>the</i> family.

540
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,249
You didn't, though.

541
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:43,318
- You really remember?
- Mm.

542
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,355
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

543
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:48,513
It's a rare talent.

544
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:50,108
Most of my squires,

545
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,761
they mean well, but young men
with big jobs, they

546
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,318
tend to overdo them.

547
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:57,917
Well, when I think back to that day...

548
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,230
You were saying?

549
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:09,949
I...

550
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:12,623
never mind.

551
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:15,075
- It's embarrassing.
- More embarrassing

552
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:18,826
than being chained to a post
covered in your own shit?

553
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:22,217
I remember everything about that day...

554
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:24,702
your helmet, your horse,

555
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:27,506
the rake line in the dirt along the list,

556
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:31,292
where the sun was in the sky
when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

557
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:35,114
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

558
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,695
I'll remember it all until I die.

559
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:44,073
That was the best day of my life.

560
00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:48,418
And I remember being on the field

561
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:50,392
after it was over.

562
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,080
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

563
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,969
And I couldn't leave.

564
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,605
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit
with my family at a table so

565
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:05,235
far on the edge of the feast
you could barely even see the bride.

566
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,690
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you

567
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,873
when I knew that they could never have the
faintest idea what I was talking about.

568
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,498
I understand completely.

569
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:16,953
How could you?

570
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:20,258
S-sorry, I...

571
00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:24,896
- I didn't mean to doubt you. It's just that I...
- I was 16 once.

572
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:29,172
I also had to replace someone's
squire on short notice.

573
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:30,752
Which knight was it?

574
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:32,422
Barristan Selmy.

575
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,150
The fight against the Kingswood outlaws.
Before your time.

576
00:37:39,628 --> 00:37:41,228
What was he like?

577
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:44,784
He was

578
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,980
a painter,

579
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,444
a painter who only used red.

580
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:59,809
I couldn't imagine being
able to fight like that,

581
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,424
not back then.

582
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:07,093
And to help him do that, to be a part
of something that perfect...

583
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,280
I don't need to explain
how that felt, not to you.

584
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:17,172
- It's hard to put into words.
- It's like stepping into a dream

585
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:22,125
you've been dreaming for as long as you can
remember and finding out that the dream

586
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,591
is more real than your life.

587
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,593
Leaving that battlefield was

588
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:32,763
like being dragged off to prison.

589
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,205
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

590
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:38,962
I didn't have your gift.

591
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:43,401
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

592
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:45,581
I was awful, a complete liability...

593
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:47,821
until...

594
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:53,663
one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

595
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:02,118
It's a good thing I am who I am.

596
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,991
I'd have been useless at anything else.

597
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:14,901
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.
Shocking, I know.

598
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:17,182
Some men are.

599
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:18,651
Ned Stark...

600
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,440
I imagine he made an excellent
prisoner right up until the end.

601
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,473
But me, though...

602
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:30,042
my life has left me uniquely
unfit for constraint.

603
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:34,002
Have you thought about...?

604
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:38,241
- Of course. Every day.
- And?

605
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:43,989
Good prisoners breed
good jailers, apparently.

606
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:46,663
The Starks are very careful.

607
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,383
But there is a way, I think.

608
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:54,251
It wasn't possible until now.

609
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:56,771
What is it?

610
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:05,093
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

611
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,787
You'll only have to do one thing.

612
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,100
Tell me.

613
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,935
You'll have to die.

614
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,020
Jorah the Andal.

615
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,530
This man must sail past old Valyria.

616
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:17,712
All who travel too close to
the Doom must have protection.

617
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:22,125
- I didn't come here for lessons.
- No, you came for the dragons.

618
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:23,462
You have them?

619
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,421
Where are they?

620
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:28,873
Draw your sword.

621
00:41:30,273 --> 00:41:32,619
See what your steel is worth.

622
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:37,976
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

623
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:45,873
You love her.

624
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:51,612
Where are the dragons?

625
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:56,669
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

626
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:02,964
Will you betray her again?

627
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:06,874
Never.

628
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,098
The thief you seek

629
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,908
is with her now.

630
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:26,851
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

631
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,860
No one is calling you a thief.

632
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,812
Who is she to accuse us?

633
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:34,882
- Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.
- Begging us?

634
00:42:35,158 --> 00:42:37,761
It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

635
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:40,194
Without me, the dragons will die.

636
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:42,023
It will be for the best.

637
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:47,524
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

638
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,942
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

639
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:51,703
You are cruel, my friend.

640
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:54,699
The mother of dragons is in the right.

641
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:57,668
She must be reunited with her babies.

642
00:42:58,781 --> 00:43:00,883
I will help you, Khaleesi.

643
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
How?

644
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,385
I will take you to the House of the Undying

645
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,227
where I have put them.

646
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,340
You have my dragons?

647
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:13,162
When I learned you were
coming to our city,

648
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:16,292
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

649
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:19,342
He procured them for me.

650
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,619
But there is no King of Qarth.

651
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,772
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.

652
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:30,136
You would keep your gates
and your minds closed

653
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,916
to everything outside your walls,

654
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,694
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

655
00:43:37,724 --> 00:43:39,934
I will open Qarth to the world

656
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,276
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

657
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,508
Your ambition is an inspiration.

658
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,142
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

659
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,781
Three dragons the size of cats

660
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:57,617
and an alliance with a charlatan
do not make you a king.

661
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:00,111
An upstart and a charlatan?

662
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,573
Empires have been built by less.

663
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:07,163
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

664
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:09,495
and those in the center
make room for them,

665
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,040
willingly or otherwise.

666
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:18,752
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

667
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:24,682
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side...

668
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,970
forever.

669
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:51,870
A mother should be with her children.

670
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:57,729
Where will you run to,
Daenerys Stormborn?

671
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:00,863
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

672
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:02,531
Come see them.

673
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:14,290
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

674
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,042
Keep your hands off me, woman.

675
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:19,369
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

676
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:22,795
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

677
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:26,311
- What is it?
- They caught the Kingslayer.

678
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,271
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
- Hang him!

679
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:39,591
You'll die today.

680
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,921
Justice for the Karstark.

681
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:56,732
Gut him!

682
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,941
Get back! I want his head!

683
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:17,980
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

684
00:46:17,981 --> 00:46:19,381
Lord Karstark,

685
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,974
this man is our prisoner.

686
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,254
- This monster killed my son.
- And crippled mine.

687
00:46:27,404 --> 00:46:31,000
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

688
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:32,129
I will have his head.

689
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,630
- And if you try and stop me...
- You will strike me down?

690
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,940
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

691
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,292
I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddark Stark.
I am the mother of your king!

692
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:44,911
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

693
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:47,030
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

694
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,638
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

695
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:53,714
- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you?

696
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,794
Threatening My Lady is an act of treason.

697
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:58,881
Treason?
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

698
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:02,811
I understand your grief, My Lord...
better than most I understand it...

699
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,060
but in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

700
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,115
stand down.

701
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:11,852
When your son returns,

702
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,023
I will demand this murderer's head.

703
00:47:14,053 --> 00:47:16,412
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

704
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:19,042
Fathers who love their sons do.

705
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,318
I will have his head.

706
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,093
Thank you for fighting
on my behalf, Lady Stark.

707
00:47:27,123 --> 00:47:29,411
I would have come to your defense, but...

708
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:31,191
Take him to the stockades.

709
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,689
Bind him with every chain you can find!

710
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:36,240
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

711
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:40,320
- There's not much fish left in you.
- And gag him!

712
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:47,215
Since when do you light your own candles?

713
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:52,705
Since I decided that I can't stand to look
at any of my handmaidens for another instant.

714
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:57,676
How many times can you
read one raven scroll?

715
00:47:57,706 --> 00:48:01,192
Stannis Baratheon's fleet
has been spotted sailing north

716
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:03,915
past Tarth... 200 ships.

717
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:07,608
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

718
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:12,032
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

719
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:13,912
We have strong, high walls.

720
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:17,982
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

721
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,129
"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting father, aren't you?

722
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:23,579
Why not?

723
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,153
He has a good mind for strategy,
doesn't he?

724
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:30,465
We call it tactics, not strategy.
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

725
00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:32,215
The best mind, some would say.

726
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:34,195
Sadly, he's not here.

727
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:37,495
It's just you, me, and Joffrey,

728
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,779
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

729
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,588
and protector of the realm.

730
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:48,449
- I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
- He needs to start acting like a king.

731
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:51,675
This war you started is coming
to our doorstep.

732
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:53,838
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead...

733
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:57,021
I'm not the one giving the boy
whores to abuse.

734
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:59,116
- I thought the girls might help him.
- Did you?

735
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,796
I was wrong.

736
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:05,927
If we can't control him...

737
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:08,287
Do you think I haven't tried?

738
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:11,826
He doesn't listen to me.

739
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:17,869
It's hard to put a leash on a dog

740
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,752
once you've put a crown on its head.

741
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:26,602
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

742
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:30,106
He looks like him...

743
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,954
in a certain light.

744
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:41,635
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

745
00:49:41,665 --> 00:49:45,339
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

746
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:49,076
Sometimes I wonder...

747
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,282
What?

748
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:55,021
If this is the price

749
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,000
for what we've done,

750
00:49:58,334 --> 00:49:59,748
for our sins.

751
00:50:00,505 --> 00:50:03,905
Sins? The Targaryens...

752
00:50:03,925 --> 00:50:07,075
Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years,
I know.

753
00:50:09,379 --> 00:50:12,729
That's what Jaime and I would say to
each other in our moments of doubt.

754
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:17,482
It's what I told Ned Stark when he
was stupid enough to confront me.

755
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,950
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

756
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,564
What's the saying?

757
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:26,977
Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin.

758
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,995
You've beaten the odds.

759
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:34,063
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.

760
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:05,733
<i>- Why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.</i>

761
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,089
<i>- There's not a king.
- That's treason.</i>

762
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:10,198
<i>So is saving Lannisters, yeah?</i>

763
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:13,270
<i>- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.</i>

764
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,026
Your son returns at dawn, My Lady?

765
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:17,206
So they say.

766
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:19,122
The Kingslayer won't last the night.

767
00:51:19,152 --> 00:51:20,559
<i>Why don't say king Robb.</i>

768
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:23,565
The more they drink,
the angrier they'll get.

769
00:51:23,843 --> 00:51:26,593
And when the Karstarks
draw their swords...

770
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:29,966
who wants to die defending a Lannister?

771
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:31,961
Come.

772
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,390
I need to be alone with him.

773
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:54,205
- My Lady, our orders...
- your orders, which I just gave you,

774
00:51:54,235 --> 00:51:56,035
are to leave me alone with him.

775
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:04,241
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

776
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:08,262
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

777
00:52:08,968 --> 00:52:10,518
Is that a woman?

778
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:11,925
Do you hear them out there?

779
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:14,888
They want your head.

780
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:19,283
Well, old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

781
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:22,530
You strangled his son with your chains.

782
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:26,782
Was he the one on guard duty?

783
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:30,520
He was in my way.

784
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:34,495
- Any Knight would have done the same.
- You are no Knight.

785
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:37,084
You have forsaken every
vow you ever took.

786
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:38,864
So many vows.

787
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:41,426
They make you swear and swear.

788
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,992
Defend the king, obey the king,

789
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,490
obey your father,

790
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:48,135
protect the innocent,
defend the weak.

791
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:51,923
But what if your father
despises the king?

792
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:56,000
What if the king massacres the innocent?

793
00:52:56,491 --> 00:52:57,791
It's too much.

794
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:02,206
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

795
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,746
Where did you find this beast?

796
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,116
She is a truer Knight
than you will ever be,

797
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,910
- Kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.

798
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:15,952
What a king he was.

799
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,376
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,

800
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:22,872
the second of his name, Lord of the
Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm,

801
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,710
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

802
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,880
You are a man without honor.

803
00:53:33,063 --> 00:53:34,063
Do you know

804
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:38,017
I've never been with any woman but Cersei?

805
00:53:38,368 --> 00:53:40,140
So in my own way,

806
00:53:41,062 --> 00:53:42,834
I have more honor than

807
00:53:44,326 --> 00:53:46,526
poor old dead Ned.

808
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,335
What was the name of that
bastard so in he fathered?

809
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:52,965
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

810
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:57,438
Snow, a bastard from the North.

811
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:03,871
Now, when... when good old Ned
came home with some whore's baby,

812
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,459
did you pretend to love it?

813
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:08,822
No.

814
00:54:09,565 --> 00:54:11,565
You're not very good at pretending.

815
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,352
You're an honest woman.

816
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:16,762
You hated that boy, didn't you?

817
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:19,592
How could you not hate him?

818
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,621
The walking, talking reminder

819
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:26,177
that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark

820
00:54:26,207 --> 00:54:28,207
fucked another woman.

821
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:32,798
Your sword.

822
00:54:38,585 --> 00:54:40,935
I told you what would happen.

823
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:42,955
All of you...

824
00:54:44,997 --> 00:54:48,947
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

825
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,869
and what would happen if you did not.

826
00:54:51,904 --> 00:54:53,140
What are you doing?

827
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,770
- If there's any who still question...
- What have you done?

828
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:58,771
whether your new lord
means what he says...

829
00:55:01,643 --> 00:55:03,993
Here is the answer to your question.

830
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:15,977
No!

831
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:25,593
