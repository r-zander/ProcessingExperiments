1
00:00:00,757 --> 00:00:02,657
Myrcella is my only daughter.

2
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:05,244
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

3
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:07,463
Dorne is the safest place for her.

4
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,663
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,712
No, wait. It wasn't her.

6
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:23,407
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,194
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,
I welcome you.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,104
It would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying,

9
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:33,597
Mother of Dragons.

10
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,142
<i>Stannis will be here in an hour.</i>

11
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,003
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

12
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,244
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,977
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

14
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,247
<i>- Do you want to be a queen?</i>
- I want to be the queen.

15
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:48,052
There on that mountain.

16
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,403
We need to get rid of those lookouts.

17
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:52,595
I need to move fast and silent.

18
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,057
Lord Commander,
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

19
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:56,087
<i>Aye.</i>

20
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,641
Are you going to kill Joffrey?

21
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,908
- If the Gods give me strength.
- And then what?

22
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:01,873
First we have to win the war.

23
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:04,824
- You never told me where you're from.
- Volantis.

24
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:07,202
You're one of them now.
I should have let you burn.

25
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:09,155
You saved me and the two I was with.

26
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:12,384
You stole three deaths from the Red God.
Speak three names.

27
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,521
I can name anyone?
And you'll kill him?

28
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,792
A man has said.

29
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:18,975
<i>The one who tortures everyone.
They call him the Tickler.</i>

30
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:22,145
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

31
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,731
More impressive prize than
a few fisherman's daughters.

32
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:27,154
Soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

33
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:29,728
the Starks would send their
men to take it back.

34
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:31,333
Take me to my ship.

35
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:34,241
Lord Stark, Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

36
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:36,577
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

37
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,534
Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

38
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:39,958
What did you see in your dream?

39
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:41,456
That the sea came to Winterfell.

40
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,215
Drowned men were floating in the yard.

41
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:44,919
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

47
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,078
I've taken your castle.

48
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:25,640
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

49
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,873
Get up. You have to get dressed.

50
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,409
I've taken Winterfell.

51
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,881
I took it. I'm occupying it.

52
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:36,845
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

53
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,876
Why?

54
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,263
To take the castle.

55
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,792
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

56
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:48,388
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight
for Robb and my father both.

57
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:52,279
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

58
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,849
Find the halfwit.

59
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,914
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

60
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,548
- Why?
- So you and I can go down

61
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:02,928
and tell them how you've
yielded Winterfell to me.

62
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,308
I won't.

63
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:05,952
Yes, you will.

64
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:07,658
I won't.

65
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,563
I'll never yield.
We'll fight you and throw you out.

66
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,610
The castle is mine,

67
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:20,960
but these people are still yours.

68
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,337
You'll yield to keep them safe,

69
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,159
to keep them alive.

70
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,389
That's what a good lord would do.

71
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,767
Think carefully about what you want to say.

72
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:38,575
Theon.

73
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,838
Did you hate us the whole time?

74
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,649
I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

75
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:52,784
Louder.

76
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,077
Say Prince Theon.

77
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,610
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.

78
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,959
You all know me.

79
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:02,634
Aye, we know you for a
steaming sack of shit.

80
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,414
Farlen, you be silent.

81
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,492
Listen to your little Lord, Farlen.

82
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,422
He has more sense than you do.

83
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,488
All of you should do as he commands.

84
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:15,373
My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

85
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,978
and declared himself
King of the Iron Islands.

86
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:21,542
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

87
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:24,651
- You are all his subjects.
- Bugger that.

88
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,224
I serve the Starks.

89
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,871
If you think you can hold
the North with this--

90
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:29,940
Shut up!

91
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,512
If you serve me as loyally
as you served Ned Stark,

92
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,141
I will be as good to you as he ever was.

93
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:39,321
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.

94
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:46,113
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke
informing my father of my victory here

95
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,825
and one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.

96
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:53,373
Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

97
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,034
You are a Maester of the Citadel

98
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:02,800
sworn to serve the lord
of Winterfell, are you not?

99
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,830
I am.

100
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:08,016
I am the Lord of Winterfell
as Bran just informed you.

101
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,741
Send the ravens.

102
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,215
My Lord.

103
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,229
My Lord Greyjoy.

104
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:24,043
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

105
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:27,569
- What do you want?
- I was brought here a captive.

106
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:30,289
You were here the day I was taken.

107
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,069
I'm the one who took you.

108
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
What of it?

109
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:36,293
Let me serve you.

110
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:38,412
Serve me how?

111
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,335
I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

112
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:44,015
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

113
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,643
Put a spear in my hand again.

114
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:49,812
So you can bury it in my neck?

115
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,820
Do you take me for a fool?

116
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,850
Get up.

117
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:54,782
Step aside.

118
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:57,788
Why?

119
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,175
It's your dream, little Lord.

120
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:04,338
The ocean has come to swallow this place.

121
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,798
I ain't letting it drown me.

122
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,051
- And in a few days' time--
<i>- Greyjoy!</i>

123
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,894
<i>What have they done to him?</i>

124
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:21,271
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

125
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,062
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

126
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:27,790
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me
that we meet as foes.

127
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,584
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

128
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:34,194
You were raised here under this roof.

129
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,509
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

130
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,300
King Robb thought of you as a brother.

131
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,605
My brothers are dead.

132
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:45,052
They died fighting Stark men,

133
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:46,687
- men like you.
- Aye, they died

134
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,166
fighting a war your father started.

135
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,327
Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.

136
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,466
Among them, but not one of them.

137
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,213
I was his hostage...

138
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,855
- taken from my home.
- If he were alive to see this--

139
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,968
He's not. He's dead.

140
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:02,454
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.

141
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,155
And Winterfell is mine.

142
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,629
I should have put a sword in your belly

143
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,548
instead of in your hand.

144
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,855
You've served this House faithfully,
old man.

145
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,562
But keep talking and I'll--

146
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:17,508
Take him to the cells. Lock him up--

147
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,647
My prince,

148
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,429
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

149
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,940
- I'll lock him in a cell until he rots--
- No!

150
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,655
He has to pay the iron price.

151
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:31,537
They'll never respect you while he lives.

152
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,937
Ser Rodrik,

153
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:52,874
I sentence you to death.

154
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:55,630
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

155
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,572
The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

156
00:09:57,602 --> 00:10:00,466
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

157
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,420
He disrespected me in front of my men.

158
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,168
That was his decision, not mine.

159
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,307
He is worth more to you alive than dead.

160
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,620
The Starks will pay.

161
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:13,169
Please, Theon,

162
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,559
think what you do.

163
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,332
You'll address me as Prince Theon
or you'll be next.

164
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:31,794
Come.

165
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,180
No!

166
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:35,700
No!

167
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,888
Theon!

168
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,134
<i>Ser Rodrik!</i>

169
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:45,589
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

170
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,607
<i>- I'm begging you!
- Coward.</i>

171
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,791
Stop! Stop right now!

172
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:56,261
You don't give commands anymore,
little Lord.

173
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,550
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Hush now, child.

174
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,452
I'm off to see your father.

175
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,511
You said no harm would come!

176
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,623
<i>You said no harm would come.
Theon, please.</i>

177
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,458
Any last words, old man?

178
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,848
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.

179
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,343
Now you are truly lost.

180
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:20,849
<i>- Theon, please, don't.
- Do something.</i>

181
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,814
<i>I'll do anything. Please!</i>

182
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,656
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

183
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,426
Ghost, stay with us.

184
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:00,266
Ghost!

185
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,592
There goes your pet.

186
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,344
He's not a pet.

187
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,000
You're right, he's not.

188
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,108
You can't tame a wild thing.

189
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,981
You can't trust a wild thing.

190
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,772
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

191
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:16,713
Wild creatures have their own rules,

192
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:18,171
their own reasons.

193
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,045
And you'll never know them.

194
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,835
Now the wildlings we're looking for

195
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,944
sleep during the day and hunt at night.

196
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:31,482
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

197
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:33,229
I said you can't.

198
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:36,690
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

199
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:39,547
- and do their killing when it's dark.
- We could do the same.

200
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,883
No, we couldn't.

201
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:43,911
This is their country.

202
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:46,150
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

203
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:48,924
I've lost good men who
fell into a crevasse

204
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:52,194
they didn't see till they were in it.

205
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,722
My father always said I'm of the North.

206
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,376
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

207
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:01,980
This look like home to you?

208
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:06,489
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

209
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:08,583
You understand me?

210
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,179
No, you don't.

211
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,332
We're at war.

212
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,388
We've always been at war.
It's never going to end 'cause

213
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,154
we're not fighting an enemy.

214
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:21,684
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

215
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,865
The Watch has given you a great gift.

216
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:27,342
You only have one thing to give in return--

217
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,395
your life.

218
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:32,306
- I'll gladly give my life.
- I don't want you to be glad about it.

219
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:36,978
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

220
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,620
And know this, boy--

221
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:43,279
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

222
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,734
They'll never know what you've done.

223
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:49,225
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name,

224
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:52,093
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

225
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,058
north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

226
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:56,814
Now...

227
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:58,727
do you understand me?

228
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:00,604
I do.

229
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,783
You're even dumber than you look.

230
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,008
It's just words, boy,

231
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:08,264
to keep us a little warmer in the night,

232
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,142
make us feel like we've got a purpose.

233
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:13,576
Come on.

234
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:18,894
We've got to find these goat fuckers
before night falls and they find us.

235
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,177
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

236
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:34,809
Can you read?

237
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:44,786
This letter detailing our infantry movements
was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.

238
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:47,686
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

239
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,527
- My apologies, My Lord. I must have--
- Girl...

240
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,250
<i>fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."</i>

241
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,867
It's the one on the--

242
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:01,596
My cupbearer can read better than you.

243
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,381
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

244
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,643
My Lord, I--

245
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:21,249
To the Starks of Winterfell!

246
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,622
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

247
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:31,679
I judged you might be good for something more
than brutalizing peasants.

248
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,293
I see I overestimated you.

249
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,900
If you ever put my son's
life at risk again, I'll...

250
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:41,913
Leave us.

251
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,746
Put the book away, girl.

252
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:03,141
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

253
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,876
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

254
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:13,004
Give us the room.

255
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,495
Clear all this.

256
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,731
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

257
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:39,075
- Wine?
- Thank you.

258
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,148
What news from the capital?

259
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:47,592
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

260
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:50,494
Ah, the late king Renly.

261
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,264
Rather a short reign.

262
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:54,244
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

263
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,806
So they say.

264
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:58,187
There has been talk of...

265
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,583
other forces at work,

266
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,828
dark forces.

267
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,114
Here.

268
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,300
Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.

269
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:18,379
It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities

270
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,083
lost soon after.

271
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:23,639
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

272
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:25,871
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

273
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,488
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

274
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:32,655
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

275
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:37,587
Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven
Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers.

276
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:38,813
Yes, yes, yes.

277
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:42,851
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

278
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,247
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

279
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,340
And Margaery--

280
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,242
Wants to be queen.

281
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,914
Yes, she does.

282
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:58,604
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne,

283
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,199
against my grandson.

284
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:02,519
They did.

285
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,407
And perhaps that treason
should be punished one day,

286
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:10,618
after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

287
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:15,275
More wine for Lord Baelish.

288
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:24,860
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

289
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,337
I believe that an advantageous agreement--

290
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,977
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?

291
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:31,007
They have.

292
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,441
Pardon, My Lord.

293
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,069
It's only wine.

294
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,690
You would ride there yourself?

295
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,966
Tonight, with your leave.

296
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,987
I'll have an answer by nightfall.
That'll be all, girl.

297
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,674
What else?

298
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:56,900
On your son Tyrion's directive,
I met with Catelyn Stark.

299
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:58,907
Why?

300
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,900
He had an interesting proposal for her

301
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,539
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

302
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:56,650
- A girl.
- A wildling.

303
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,949
We could question her.

304
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:01,609
You could.

305
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,622
She won't answer.

306
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,755
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

307
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:09,648
What's your name?

308
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,078
Ygritte.

309
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,000
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

310
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:17,331
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

311
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,040
I gave you my name.

312
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:23,080
I'm Jon Snow.

313
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:33,320
You ought to burn them you killed.

314
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,807
We'd need a big fire for that.

315
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,833
Tell me, Ygritte,

316
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,939
why do you want us to build a big fire?

317
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,752
Are there some more friends in the area?

318
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:48,464
Burn them or maybe you'll need
those swords again.

319
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,417
Our boy here's already killed one dead man.
He can do it again if he has to.

320
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:55,661
What waits beyond the pass?

321
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,619
- The Free Folk.
- How many?

322
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,900
Hundreds and thousands.

323
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,791
More than you've ever seen, crow.

324
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:07,152
Why come to the mountains?

325
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,010
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

326
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,057
Do you mean to march on the Wall?

327
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,968
Do you know who I am, girl?

328
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,471
Qhorin Halfhand.

329
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,439
Tell me true.

330
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,452
If your people captured me,

331
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,545
would they take me prisoner?

332
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,385
They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.

333
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,318
If not, they'd kill you slow.

334
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:50,413
We have no food for her.

335
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,992
Can't spare a man to watch her.

336
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:56,613
Can't let her go. She'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

337
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,975
- It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
- No.

338
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:02,665
No, I'll do it.

339
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,401
Come, brothers.

340
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,556
We'll leave him to it.

341
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,109
We'll meet you at the top.
Don't take too long.

342
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,418
We're deep in their country now.

343
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:29,846
You never killed a woman before, did you?

344
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,633
You don't need to do it.

345
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:36,158
Mance would take you.
I know he would.

346
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:40,353
There's secret ways.
The crows would never catch us.

347
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,223
I'm as much a crow as they are.

348
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,690
Will you burn me...

349
00:22:58,615 --> 00:22:59,865
after?

350
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,068
Can't.

351
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:05,299
Someone might see the smoke.

352
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:13,217
Strike hard and true,

353
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,152
Jon Snow,

354
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,145
or I'll come back and haunt you.

355
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:23,644
That's cold.

356
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,295
Go on.

357
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,561
Be quick about it.

358
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:39,361
Do it.

359
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:44,579
Bastard, do it!

360
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:03,701
You can't do it. We both know it.

361
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:10,752
The sun's going down, Jon Snow.

362
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:13,762
And your friends are nowhere close.

363
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:15,332
I'll find them.

364
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:18,764
Call for them. Go on.

365
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,421
Call loudly.

366
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,478
<i>May the Seven guide the princess
on her journey.</i>

367
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:33,989
<i>May the Mother give her health.</i>

368
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:36,346
May the Crone give her wisdom.

369
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:39,112
May the Warrior give her courage.

370
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:47,221
One day I pray you love someone.

371
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:49,705
I pray you love her so much,

372
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:52,753
when you close your eyes,
you see her face.

373
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:56,123
I want that for you.

374
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,789
I want you to know what it's like
to love someone,

375
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:03,395
to truly love someone,

376
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,620
before I take her from you.

377
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:27,053
You sound like a little cat
mewling for his mother.

378
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,645
Princes don't cry.

379
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:32,062
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, My Lady?

380
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,877
My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.

381
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,227
So?

382
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,206
It seems a normal thing.

383
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,391
- Is your little brother a prince?
- No.

384
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,519
Not really relevant, then, is it?

385
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:49,944
Come, dog.

386
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,978
<i>Hail, Joffrey!</i>

387
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:02,314
<i>Hail to the king.</i>

388
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:06,572
Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.

389
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:08,622
<i>Murderer! Bastard!</i>

390
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:10,278
<i>All hail the king.</i>

391
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:13,192
<i>He's no king. He's a bastard!</i>

392
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:16,067
Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.

393
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:21,690
- Freak!
- Get the prince back to the keep now.

394
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,541
Yes, My Lord. Come, quickly.

395
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:26,073
<i>Please, Your Grace, give us some food!</i>

396
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,381
<i>Bread, Your Grace, please!</i>

397
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,637
Who threw that?

398
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:37,464
I want the man who threw that.
Find who did that and bring him to me!

399
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:39,045
<i>- Hold on!
- Hold them back!</i>

400
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,451
Just kill them! Kill them all!

401
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,339
- Move. Move!
- Pull back!

402
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,298
<i>Tear him to pieces!</i>

403
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:52,741
What are you doing?

404
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:57,015
- I want these people executed!
- And they want the same for you.

405
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:25,305
Where's Sansa?

406
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:28,964
<i>Through the door!</i>

407
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:32,804
Come on!

408
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:37,961
Protect the king!

409
00:28:37,991 --> 00:28:40,229
- Get back!
- Fall back!

410
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,279
- Move!
- To the gates!

411
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:58,307
- Come in! Come in!
- Keep him safe!  - Motherfucker!

412
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:02,885
- Watch out. Hold them back.
- Come on.

413
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,474
Hey!

414
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:14,818
Traitors!

415
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:18,544
- I'll have all their heads.
- Oh, you blind, bloody fool.

416
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,350
You can't insult me.

417
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,637
We've had vicious kings and
we've had idiot kings,

418
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,976
but I don't know if we've ever been cursed
with a vicious idiot for a king.

419
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:27,819
- You can't--
- I can, I am.

420
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,987
- They attacked me!
- They threw a cow pie at you,

421
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:34,827
so you decided to kill them all?
They're starving, you fool.

422
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,531
- All because of a war you started.
- You're talking to a king!

423
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,283
And now I've struck a king.

424
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,876
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

425
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:47,045
- Where is the Stark girl?
- Let them have her.

426
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:50,575
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

427
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:53,153
You owe him quite a bit, you know.

428
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,687
Where are you going?

429
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:08,056
- You ever been fucked, little girl?
<i>- Come here.</i>

430
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:16,512
- Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
- I take my orders from the king.

431
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:18,213
<i>This way!</i>

432
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:26,319
Please!

433
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,157
No, no.

434
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,292
Please!

435
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,407
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

436
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,992
- We'll get you. We'll get you.
- This way.

437
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:17,718
Are you hurt, My Lady?

438
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:19,292
The little bird's bleeding.

439
00:31:19,322 --> 00:31:20,911
Someone take her back to her cage,

440
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:23,746
- see to that cut.
- Well done, Clegane.

441
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:26,896
I didn't do it for you.

442
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:31,033
He shouldn't make me wait.

443
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:35,162
The Spice King is the second
wealthiest man in Qarth.

444
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:37,465
He makes everyone wait.

445
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,906
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

446
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:43,525
if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.

447
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:45,389
I already have a husband.

448
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,768
Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.

449
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:51,022
You are far too young
to be a widow forever.

450
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:52,217
And...

451
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,260
far too beautiful.

452
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:58,246
And you are far too smart
to think that I will succumb to flattery.

453
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:01,338
I have travelled very far in my life

454
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:03,086
and met many women,

455
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:04,952
but none that are immune to flattery.

456
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:07,748
<i>- The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

457
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:09,229
Here he comes.

458
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,248
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

459
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:15,168
Terrible dreams.

460
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:18,195
I could not sleep until the sun was shining

461
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:20,180
and the birds were singing.

462
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,477
Look what a beauty you are

463
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:26,398
now the Red Waste has been washed off you.

464
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:29,840
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.

465
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,157
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.

466
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:39,998
Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely
for a glorified dockworker like yourself.

467
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,635
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

468
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,791
who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,

469
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:49,036
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

470
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:53,766
Every lady alive was lovelier
and higher born than my grandfather.

471
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:59,468
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

472
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:03,276
I'll have them flogged in the square.
Thank you, My Lord. You are a gracious host,

473
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:06,058
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

474
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:09,135
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

475
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,415
So, my little princess,

476
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,019
what is it you want?

477
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:16,679
My birthright--
the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

478
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:18,996
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

479
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,197
I cannot give you what I do not have.

480
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,803
I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms.

481
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:27,173
I'm asking you for ships.
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

482
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:29,051
I need my ships as well.

483
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:32,799
I use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.

484
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:34,638
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid

485
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:37,345
three times over when I retake
the Iron Throne.

486
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,853
Retake?

487
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,670
- Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
- My father sat there

488
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:44,431
before he was murdered.

489
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:50,049
But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it
not be correct to say take the Iron Throne?

490
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,020
I didn't come here to argue grammar.

491
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,728
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

492
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,161
So let me explain my position,
little princess.

493
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:02,986
Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.

494
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:08,032
I make my living by trade.
And I judge every trade on its merits.

495
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,916
You ask for ships.

496
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:13,214
You say I shall be repaid triple.

497
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,420
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

498
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,712
But before you repay your debts,
you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

499
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:22,345
Do you have an army?

500
00:34:22,464 --> 00:34:24,849
- Not yet.
- You do not have an army.

501
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,356
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

502
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,338
There are many there that support my claim.

503
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,608
When were you there last?

504
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:34,050
I left when I was a baby.

505
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,415
So, in truth, you have no allies.

506
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:40,859
The people will rise to fight for their
rightful Queen when I return.

507
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:46,015
Forgive me, little princess,
but I cannot make an investment

508
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:48,141
based on wishes and dreams.

509
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,319
- Now if you'll pardon me.
- Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos?

510
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:55,009
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

511
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,349
For my wedding he gave me three petrified
dragon eggs. He believed--

512
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:03,159
the world believed--
that the ages had turned them to stone.

513
00:35:03,307 --> 00:35:06,634
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

514
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:07,909
But I dreamt...

515
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,092
that if I carried those eggs
into a great fire, they would hatch.

516
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:16,665
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

517
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:19,071
But when the fire burned out,

518
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,059
I was unhurt,

519
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:23,714
the Mother of Dragons.

520
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:28,572
Do you understand?

521
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:33,998
I'm no ordinary woman.

522
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,918
My dreams come true.

523
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:43,907
I admire your passion.

524
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:48,946
But in business, I trust in logic,
not passion.

525
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:53,253
- I'm sorry, little princess.
- I am not your little princess.

526
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:56,286
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

527
00:35:56,316 --> 00:35:58,251
and I will take what is mine.

528
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,672
With fire and blood, I will take it.

529
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,492
Yes, My Lady,

530
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:04,572
but not with my ships.

531
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,339
Who taught you to read?

532
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:28,604
My father, My Lord.

533
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,932
I taught my son Jaime to read.

534
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,720
The Maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

535
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:41,749
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

536
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,231
He reversed them in his head.

537
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,957
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

538
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:50,705
and that we simply must accept it. Ha!

539
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:58,411
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

540
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:02,829
He hated me for it, for a time.

541
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,209
For a long time,

542
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:08,077
but he learned.

543
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,623
Where is your father? Is he alive?

544
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:20,475
Who was he?

545
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:23,115
A stonemason.

546
00:37:23,788 --> 00:37:25,950
A stonemason who could read?

547
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,654
He taught himself.

548
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:30,232
Quite a man.

549
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,540
What killed him?

550
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:37,189
Loyalty.

551
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,812
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

552
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,323
Did...

553
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:50,893
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

554
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:53,480
No...

555
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,764
But you've already begun.

556
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:01,192
Did you know your father, My Lord?

557
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:03,269
I did.

558
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,718
I grew up with him.

559
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,733
I watched him grow old.

560
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,423
He loved us.

561
00:38:16,807 --> 00:38:18,637
He was a good man,

562
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:21,678
but a weak man,

563
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:26,077
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

564
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,572
I'm cold.

565
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,400
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

566
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:50,316
<b>Robb Stark moving troops south by coast.</b>

567
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,440
Where are you going, girl?

568
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:06,206
The armory, My Lord.

569
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:09,522
- Why?
- Lord Tywin sent me.

570
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,740
What might this be?

571
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,270
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

572
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,927
What for?

573
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:21,737
To take to the armory.

574
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:25,344
Why would he do that?

575
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,821
Let's go and ask him.

576
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,542
Move!

577
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,187
Get out of the way!

578
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,286
Amory Lorch.

579
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:10,987
A girl has named a second name.

580
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:13,604
- A man will do what must be done.
- Now!

581
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:17,982
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

582
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,544
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

583
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:25,118
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away. It has to be now.

584
00:40:32,684 --> 00:40:33,684
Guard!

585
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:47,470
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

586
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,793
My honor, Your Grace.

587
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,357
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

588
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:25,662
Lady Talisa.

589
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:28,566
Your Grace.

590
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:31,835
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

591
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,325
Westerosi customs are
still a bit foreign to me.

592
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:36,855
It's hard to keep all
the rules straight. But...

593
00:41:37,474 --> 00:41:39,397
if I remember my lessons,

594
00:41:39,724 --> 00:41:42,138
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

595
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,172
unless she's a queen or a princess.

596
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,911
I could find someone who knows.

597
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:49,388
Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

598
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:51,411
Because it's obvious.

599
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:55,353
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

600
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:58,536
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

601
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:01,406
I'd call you a liar.

602
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,854
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

603
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,507
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

604
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:14,286
Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

605
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:20,857
Quite a pretty spot.

606
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:22,909
Will we be here long?

607
00:42:23,572 --> 00:42:26,594
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

608
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,802
I'm not a spy.

609
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,981
Of course a spy would
deny being a spy.

610
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,219
You're right.

611
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:37,288
You've found me out.
I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.

612
00:42:37,318 --> 00:42:39,543
"The Young Wolf is on the move."

613
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:44,050
Perhaps you'd join me...

614
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,825
If you've got time, of course, for, well...

615
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:48,898
Robb.

616
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:52,458
Mother.

617
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:02,092
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

618
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:04,237
She's been helping with the wounded.

619
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:05,897
She's been very...

620
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:07,441
helpful.

621
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:09,058
Lady Talisa.

622
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:10,289
Lady Stark.

623
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:12,489
Lady Talisa...?

624
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:14,276
Maegyr.

625
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:15,344
Maegyr?

626
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:18,977
Forgive me, I do not know this name.

627
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:22,769
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

628
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:25,673
Excuse me, My Lady. Your Grace.

629
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:36,382
I've missed you.

630
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,055
Yes, you look positively forlorn.

631
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:42,423
You surprised me, that's all.

632
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:45,372
I didn't think I'd see you today.

633
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:48,606
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

634
00:43:48,636 --> 00:43:49,709
I know.

635
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:53,124
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

636
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,523
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

637
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,956
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

638
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,371
a debt that must be paid.

639
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:05,996
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

640
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,186
My Lady.

641
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,390
News from Winterfell.

642
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:24,426
Your brothers desert you?

643
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:27,670
I can tell you which way to go.

644
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,759
We'll stop here.

645
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:32,037
Too dark to go any farther today.

646
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:33,067
Here?

647
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,123
- There's no shelter here.
- There's no shelter anywhere.

648
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:37,327
There is...

649
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:39,886
if you know where to look.

650
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:44,235
The cold could kill us both.

651
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,589
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

652
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,925
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

653
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,054
Have it your way.

654
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:03,258
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

655
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:08,270
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

656
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,249
Bet your life.

657
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,461
Think they're out looking for you?

658
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:42,454
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

659
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,241
Yes.

660
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:49,383
You're brave.

661
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:52,268
Stupid,

662
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,475
but brave.

663
00:45:57,832 --> 00:46:00,854
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

664
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,128
Stop moving.

665
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:20,701
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

666
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:23,292
Stop it!

667
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:38,581
- You're still moving.
- Was I?

668
00:46:39,106 --> 00:46:41,115
I didn't notice that time.

669
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:54,341
This cannot be true.

670
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:56,705
We've had ravens from White Harbor,

671
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:58,627
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

672
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,123
I'm afraid it is true.

673
00:47:01,265 --> 00:47:02,323
Why?

674
00:47:02,526 --> 00:47:05,809
- Why would Theon--
- Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

675
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:09,042
- My brothers?
- We've heard nothing of them.

676
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:12,993
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

677
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:18,060
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

678
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:22,328
I must go North at once.

679
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:24,088
There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

680
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:27,271
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

681
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:30,442
- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't--
- You are a king.

682
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,233
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

683
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:34,882
Let me go and talk to Theon.

684
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:38,326
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

685
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:41,209
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

686
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:43,915
Let me send word to my bastard
at the Dreadfort.

687
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:48,006
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

688
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:50,267
We have the Lannisters on the run.

689
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:55,562
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

690
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:59,294
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

691
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:04,084
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

692
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,850
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

693
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,259
I want to look him in the eye
and ask him why.

694
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,785
And then I'll take his head myself.

695
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:17,530
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

696
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,017
I'm no liar.

697
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:24,673
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

698
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:27,462
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

699
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:29,872
I hate the Starks as well as you do.

700
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:32,183
Let me serve you, My Lord.

701
00:48:32,586 --> 00:48:35,705
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

702
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,470
There are other ways to serve, My Lord.

703
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:41,035
I'm a prince now, and you'd do well--

704
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:43,796
There are other ways to serve, my prince.

705
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:49,486
Like what?

706
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:55,516
We know things, the free people.

707
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,216
You know things?

708
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:00,005
Like what?

709
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:01,811
How to eat dirt?

710
00:49:03,806 --> 00:49:04,806
Other things.

711
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:08,201
Savage things.

712
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:12,218
Wait outside.

713
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:32,544
I always wondered what
you had under there.

714
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:35,368
It comes at a price.

715
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:39,159
- I'm not killing you. That's your price.
- I already had that.

716
00:49:40,663 --> 00:49:42,124
What do you want, then,

717
00:49:42,154 --> 00:49:44,002
other than your miserable life?

718
00:49:44,827 --> 00:49:46,849
What all free people want--

719
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,179
my freedom.

720
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:55,908
Well, you shall have it, then.

721
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,581
But only if you serve me well.

722
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:11,390
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

723
00:50:11,544 --> 00:50:13,088
They thought so, too.

724
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:15,643
He hated me, the man who hit me.

725
00:50:15,673 --> 00:50:17,853
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

726
00:50:18,776 --> 00:50:20,798
He never met me before, but...

727
00:50:21,364 --> 00:50:22,647
he wanted to hurt me.

728
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:26,135
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

729
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:28,334
You are everything he will never have.

730
00:50:28,364 --> 00:50:31,559
Your horse eats better than his children.

731
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:34,003
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

732
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:37,026
I would have given them bread if I had it.

733
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:39,007
I hate the King more than any of them.

734
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,233
Don't say these things.

735
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,061
- If the wrong people hear you--
- But you're not the wrong people.

736
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,069
Don't trust anybody.

737
00:50:52,722 --> 00:50:54,272
Life is safer that way.

738
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,740
And where are you going?

739
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:42,642
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

740
00:51:42,672 --> 00:51:44,926
- What?
- Me.

741
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:50,247
He says I'm to make the rounds.

742
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:58,332
And keep you warm.

743
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,932
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

744
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:31,435
The Silk King won't support me

745
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:35,224
because of his business with the Lannisters.
Why offend his best customer?

746
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,627
And the Copper King offers
me a single ship

747
00:52:38,828 --> 00:52:41,624
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

748
00:52:41,803 --> 00:52:44,825
Does he think I will whore
myself for a boat?

749
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,475
When I came to this city,

750
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:48,745
I had nothing.

751
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:51,172
Truly nothing.

752
00:52:51,557 --> 00:52:53,004
I slept by the docks.

753
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:56,275
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

754
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,915
If not, I dreamed of food.

755
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,551
Today I am the richest man in Qarth.

756
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:07,421
Do you think the path from poverty to wealth
is always pure and honorable?

757
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:10,296
I have done many things, Khaleesi,

758
00:53:10,326 --> 00:53:12,261
that a righteous man would condemn.

759
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:16,802
And here I am, with no regrets.

760
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,852
Bar the gates. Ring the bells.

761
00:53:33,816 --> 00:53:35,012
Slowly, Khaleesi.

762
00:53:45,581 --> 00:53:46,581
Where are they?

763
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,316
Where are my dragons?!

764
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:24,179
