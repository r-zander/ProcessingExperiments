00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,500
<i>The Tyrells are a problem.</i>

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,117
The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.

3
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:06,588
You must see Highgarden.

4
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:09,025
I don't think the queen would
let me leave King's Landing.

5
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,008
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be Queen.

6
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:14,538
And if you were to marry Loras...

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,272
You must give yourself to the Lord of Light.

8
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:19,842
- I have a wife.
- She's shut away in a tower.

9
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:22,907
And she's given you no sons, only stillborns.

10
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:26,686
I lost one son to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,495
- I grieve for your sons, my lord.
- I don't...

12
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:30,787
want your grief. I want my vengeance.

13
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:37,406
Do that again and I'll take your other hand.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,160
- What value was the mill?
- I seized an opportunity.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,018
<i>We took hostages.</i>

16
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,722
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.

17
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,209
I'm not your enemy.

18
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,823
This woman is evil!

19
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:51,080
Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.

20
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,952
You want to assassinate a girl?
Based on whose information?

21
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:57,731
He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.

22
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:00,081
You bring us the whispers of a traitor.

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,155
If you mean to murder me,
then bloody well get on with it.

24
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,499
You'll die soon enough, but it won't be murder.

25
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,954
I sentence you to trial by combat.

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,327
Is it done, then?

27
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:25,324
Dracarys.

Lord...

33
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,021
cast your light upon us.

34
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:36,319
<i>Lord of Light, defend us.</i>

35
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:41,075
Show us the truth.

36
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:45,989
Strike this man down if he is guilty.
Give strength to his sword if he is true.

37
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,121
Lord of Light...

38
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:50,426
give us wisdom.

39
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:56,870
For the night is dark

40
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,007
and full of terrors.

41

<i>For the night is dark and full of terrors.</i>

42
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,152
Get back.

43
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,596
<i>Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.</i>

44
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,278
Kill him!

45
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,072
Lord, cast your light upon this man,
your servant.

46
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,026
Bring him back from death and darkness.

47
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,264
His flame has been extinguished.
Restore it.

48
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:33,567
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
Lord, cast...

49
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,136
Arya, don't!

50
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:38,398
Bring him back from death and darkness...

51
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:41,742
No! Let go of me! Let me go!

52
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:45,272
Looks like their god likes me
more than your butcher's boy.

53
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:46,878
Burn in hell!

54
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,660
He will.

55
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,387
But not today.

56
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:22,180
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

57
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,881
Tell me what you know.

58
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,504
There are four to a patrol.

59
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,901
Two builders to check for structural damage,
two rangers to watch for enemies.

60
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:32,823
How often do these patrols go out?

61
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,322
It varies.

62
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,604
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

63
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,185
You'd like to know that.

64
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:44,996
There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.

65
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,597
How many are manned?

66
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,550
Three.

67
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,356
You sure of that?

68
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:56,573
Which three?

69
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:01,224
Castle Black.

70
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,198
<i>Aye, Castle Black.</i>

71
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:05,285
Everyone knows Castle Black.

72
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,729
Which others?

73
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:14,162
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

74
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,374
and the Shadow Tower.

75
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,905
How many men remain in Castle Black?

76
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,840
- 1,000.
- Liar.

77
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,826
What happens to your eagle after I kill you?

78
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:31,058
Does he drift away like a
kite with his strings cut

79
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:32,629
or does he just flop dead to the ground?

80
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,048
He's no crow.

81
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,615
Just 'cause you want him inside you
don't make him one of us.

82
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,283
I'm not afraid of you.

83
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,322
I like you, boy.

84
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:49,832
But if you lie to me,

85
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:53,194
I'll pull your guts out through your throat.

86
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,768
1,000 men.

87
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,637
We'll find out soon enough.

88
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,846
I don't need you to protect me.

89
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,221
Of course you do.

90
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:18,694
Who stopped Rattleshirt when he
was about to cut your throat?

91
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,920
Who vouched for you with Mance?

92
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,449
It seems you owe me a debt.

93
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:26,348
Give it back.

94
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:27,767
Well, I stole it.

95
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,860
It's mine. If you want it,

96
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,626
come steal it back.

97
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,060
Seven hells.

98
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,788
Is Orell right?

99
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,672
Are you still a crow?

100
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,454
It's time you proved yourself.

101
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,726
You swore some vows.

102
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:06,047
I want you to break 'em.

103
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,544
I want you to see me.

104
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:14,904
All of me.

105
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,707
We shouldn't.

106
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,876
We should.

107
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,904
Why are you still dressed?

108
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:00,132
You know nothing, Jon Sno...

109
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,926
That thing you did

110
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,541
with your mouth.

111
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:23,839
Is that what lords do to
their ladies in the South?

112
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,466
I don't know.

113
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,700
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

114
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,752
You seemed to like it.

115
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:32,866
<i>Aye, I liked it some.</i>

116
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,545
Who taught you that?

117
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,683
There's been no one else.

118
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:37,827
Only you.

119
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,247
A maid.

120
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,796
You were a maid.

121
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,291
I was a man of the Night's Watch.

122
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:47,982
How about you? Were you a maid?

123
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,636
What do you think?

124
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:50,907
Who was he?

125
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,326
Just a boy.

126
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,119
He came trading with his brothers.

127
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,183
He had red hair like me.

128
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,010
Kissed by fire, but...

129
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:01,967
he was weak.

130
00:12:03,282 --> 00:12:04,507
Not like you.

131
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:08,565
That was the first one.
Then there was this Thenn boy.

132
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:11,894
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

133
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,960
Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough.

134
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:19,766
We'd best get back.

135
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:20,797
Tormund...

136
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,192
I'm not done with you yet.

137
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:35,690
How long's it been since you had a bath?

138
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,446
Let's not go back.

139
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,526
Let's stay here a while longer.

140
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,453
I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

141
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:06,756
Not ever.

142
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:19,334
<i>I want my gold.</i>

143
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,622
It says it clearly right there on that note
you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.

144
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:23,698
Piss on that!

145
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:26,014
- You're nothing but thieves.
- We're outlaws.

146
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:28,716
Outlaws steal.
You're lucky we didn't kill you.

147
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:31,568
Come try it, archer.
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.

148
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,847
You can't let him go. He's a murderer.
He's guilty.

149
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,074
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

150
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:37,120
Enough!

151
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,042
The judgment isn't ours to make.

152
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,374
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.

153
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:47,615
The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.

154
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:53,804
<i>Riders coming through!</i>

155
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:07,904
Down!

156
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,063
On your knees.

157
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,642
I give you the Kingslayer.

158
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,187
Pick him up, Locke.

159
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,566
- You've lost a hand.
- No, my lord.

160
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:27,966
He has it here.

161
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:33,595
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

162
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,394
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

163
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:39,055
Cut her free. Apologies, my lady.

164
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:41,444
You're under my protection now.

165
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:43,650
Thank you, my lord.

166
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,978
Find suitable rooms for our guests.

167
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,839
We'll speak later.

168
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,187
Lord Bolton.

169
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,341
Is there word from the capital?

170
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,943
You haven't heard?

171
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,041
Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.

172
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:10,693
Sailed into Blackwater Bay.

173
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,789
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.

174
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,598
And your sister...

175
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,065
How can I put this?

176
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,611
Your sister...

177
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,546
is alive and well.

178
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,065
Your father's forces prevailed.

179
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,251
Ser Jaime isn't well.

180
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,570
Take him to Qyburn.

181
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,627
- Will I die?
- No.

182
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,745
The corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cut away.

183
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:09,168
The safest course would be
to take the whole arm off.

184
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,826
Then you'll die.

185
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:14,886
You're no maester.

186
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,431
Where's your chain?

187
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,582
The Citadel stripped me of it.

188
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,463
They found some of my experiments

189
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,465
too bold.

190
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:29,137
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

191
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:32,941
I don't need my right hand to kill you.

192
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,533
I can take away the rotting flesh

193
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:40,915
and try and burn out the corruption
with boiling wine.

194
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:43,618
With any luck, that will suffice.

195
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,634
You'll need milk of the poppy.

196
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,702
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

197
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,888
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

198
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,225
I'll scream loudly.

199
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
Your Grace.

200
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:35,212
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

201
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,276
Of course, Your Grace.

202
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,779
I have reason to believe that House Tyrell
do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.

203
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,279
I see. And have you shared these
suspicions with Lord Tywin?

204
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,366
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

205
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,951
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

206
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,332
And he appreciates those who aid
his family, as you well know.

207
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:57,893
He's almost as generous to those who help us
as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.

208
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,394
You have a good working
relationship with the Tyrells.

209
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,526
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

210
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,535
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

211
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,443
And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

212
00:18:09,473 --> 00:18:10,935
I assure you that it will.

213
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,720
Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.

214
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,211
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

215
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:24,117
Are there any figs? Fetch some.

216
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,984
I always take figs midafternoon.
They help move the bowels.

217
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,209
To what do I owe this summons?

218
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,261
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

219
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,639
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

220
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,002
I climbed all those steps to
discuss financial matters?

221
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:40,979
It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

222
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,100
Naturally.

223
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,887
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

224
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,823
The word extravagant has been used.

225
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:51,114
What good is the word extravagant
if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?

226
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,812
- I understand that.
- Good.

227
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,574
But, as Master of Coin,

228
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,111
it falls upon me
to calculate the cost for the crown.

229
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:59,519
As of now, it's a huge expense.

230
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:00,686
And?

231
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,786
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

232
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:06,793
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

233
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:10,163
- Yes, and maintaining supply lines...
- I can't think how it slipped my mind.

234
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:14,866
What is it, 12,000 infantrymen
the Tyrell family has supplied?

235
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,158
1,800 mounted lances.

236
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,116
2,000 in support.

237
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,211
Provisions so this city might survive the winter.

238
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:23,613
A million bushels of wheat.

239
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:27,179
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

240
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:30,583
20,000 head of cattle.
50,000 sheep.

241
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:33,618
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

242
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,126
I'm quite familiar with them.

243
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:39,618
And we're so grateful for your contributions which
are necessary for the preservation of the realm.

244
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:41,821
As is a royal wedding.

245
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:44,227
The people are hungry for more than just food.

246
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:45,901
They crave distractions.

247
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:48,910
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

248
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:53,852
And their distractions are likely to end
with us being torn to pieces.

249
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,210
A royal wedding is much safer.

250
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:59,081
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

251
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,650
And traditionally paid for

252
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,386
by the royal family.

253
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,287
I was told you were drunk, impertinent,
and thoroughly debauched.

254
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:14,026
You can imagine my disappointment
at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

255
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,167
Where did you go for them, Volantis?

256
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,103
- My lady.
- Oh, very well.

257
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,998
I won't have it said that House Tyrell
refuses to play its part.

258
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:29,111
We'll pay for half the expenses
and the celebrations will go on as planned.

259
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:31,472
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient. Thank you.

260
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:34,006
Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

261
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,454
Give me that.

262
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,485
What are you doing?

263
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:48,774
Just mending Lord Beric's armor.

264
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:49,804
Why?

265
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:53,613
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

266
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,008
Have you lost your mind?

267
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:58,969
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

268
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:01,234
They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.
- The Lannisters wanted to kill me

269
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:03,060
long before I joined the Brotherhood.

270
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,215
You don't have to do this.

271
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,374
I want to.

272
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,933
They need good men.
- Robb needs good men, too.

273
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:11,313
We're leaving tomorrow.

274
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:13,661
- And then you...
- What? Serve him?

275
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:17,442
I've served men my entire life.

276
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,634
I served Master Mott at King's Landing
and he sold me to the Watch.

277
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,098
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,
wondering every day

278
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:27,378
if I'd get tortured or killed.

279
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,882
I'm done serving.

280
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:32,862
You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

281
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,953
He may be their leader, but they chose him.

282
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:39,038
These men are brothers.

283
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,572
They're a family.

284
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,811
I've never had a family.

285
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,893
I can be your family.

286
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,510
You wouldn't be my family.

287
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:56,102
You'd be "my lady. "

288
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,660
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth!

289
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,452
- Take him!
- Please, I didn't do anything.

290
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,832
I'm just a squire. Please...

291
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:45,645
Bring them in.

292
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,077
Is that all of them?

293
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,896
It took five of you
to murder two unarmed squires?

294
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,157
Not murder, Your Grace.

295
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,887
- Vengeance.
- Vengeance?

296
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:17,656
Those boys didn't kill your sons.

297
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,165
I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield and Torrhen...

298
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,561
Was strangled by the Kingslayer.

299
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:25,291
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

300
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,079
Look at them.

301
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,436
Tell your mother to look at them.

302
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:34,526
She killed them as much as I.

303
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:37,451
My mother had nothing to do with this.

304
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:41,322
This was your treason.
- It's treason to free your enemies.

305
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:45,996
In war, you kill your enemies.
Did your father not teach you that, boy?

306
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,026
Leave him.

307
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,072
<i>Aye.</i>

308
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,047
Leave me to the king.

309
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:59,608
He wants to give me a scolding
before he sets me free.

310
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:03,424
That's how he deals with treason.

311
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:06,217
Our King in the North.

312
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,683
Or should I call him

313
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,793
the King Who Lost the North?

314
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:18,481
Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.
Hang the rest.

315
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:21,846
Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.
I only watched for the guards.

316
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,779
This one was only the watcher.

317
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,178
Hang him last so he can watch the others die.

318
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,906
<i>Please! Please, no. They made me do it!</i>

319
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,389
<i>They made me!</i>

320
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,049
Word of this can't leave Riverrun.

321
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,600
They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.

322
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,837
The Lannisters pay their debts.
They never stop talking about it.

323
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,977
Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?

324
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,802
It wouldn't be lying.

325
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:54,090
We will bury them and remain silent

326
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,674
until the war is done.
- I'm not fighting for justice

327
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,918
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

328
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,412
no matter how highborn.

329
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:04,898
He has to die.

330
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,460
The Karstarks are Northmen.

331
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:10,167
They won't forgive the killing of their lord.

332
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:11,747
Your mother's right.

333
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:15,072
If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.

334
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,902
You tended to their wounds.

335
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,240
You brought them supper.

336
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,462
Now they're dead.
- And more boys will keep dying

337
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:25,970
until this war is over.
You need Karstark men to end it.

338
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,598
Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

339
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:29,728
A hostage.

340
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,761
Tell the Karstarks that as
long as they remain loyal,

341
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,420
he will not be harmed.

342
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:06,065
The blood of the First Men flows through my veins
as much as yours, boy.

343
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,632
I fought the Mad King for your father.

344
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:13,112
I fought Joffrey for you.

345
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:15,316
We are kin.

346
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:17,381
Stark and Karstark.

347
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,979
That didn't stop you from betraying me.

348
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:21,771
And it won't save you now.

349
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,501
I don't want it to save me.

350
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:28,578
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.

351
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,820
Kneel, my lord.

352
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:41,396
Rickard Karstark,

353
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:43,378
Lord of Karhold,

354
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:47,915
here in sight of gods and men,
I sentence you to die.

355
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:50,461
Would you speak a final word?

356
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:53,721
Kill me and be cursed.

357
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:56,069
You are no king of mine.

358
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,791
What are you going to do with me?

359
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:36,804
At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.

360
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,614
Your brother's there now.

361
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,818
He'll make a contribution to our cause

362
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:42,548
and you can go home.

363
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:45,250
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

364
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,811
Don't think of it that way.

365
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:47,941
But it is that way.

366
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:49,228
It is.

367
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:50,792
And it isn't.

368
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:52,722
More is than isn't.

369
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,257
Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.

370
00:27:57,664 --> 00:28:00,767
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
- So why don't you?

371
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:02,645
We need the gold.

372
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,976
Do I frighten you, child?

373
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:18,077
No.

374
00:28:21,912 --> 00:28:23,322
You're angry with me.

375
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,602
And I don't blame you.

376
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:26,962
But letting him go was the right thing.

377
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:29,117
I have more reason than most to want him hanged.

378
00:28:29,147 --> 00:28:31,603
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

379
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:32,633
But how...?

380
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:38,135
...how many times have you brought me back?

381
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:41,065
It's the Lord of Light brings you back.

382
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,550
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

383
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,812
- How many times?
- Five, I think.

384
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:47,710
No, this makes six.

385
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,695
Six.
- There was the first time...

386
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:52,945
The Mountain.

387
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:54,054
Show her.

388
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:57,281
Lance right through the chest.

389
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,497
Then I was stabbed in the belly.

390
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:04,369
Then it was an arrow in the back.
And that axe in the side.

391
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,326
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

392
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,742
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
- Both.

393
00:29:12,957 --> 00:29:15,631
Fuckers couldn't decide.

394
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,692
And the Hound makes six.

395
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:19,859
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

396
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,911
You'd think you'd learn.

397
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:25,393
It's not getting any easier, you know.

398
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,439
I know.

399
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,790
Every time I come back,

400
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,786
I'm a bit less.

401
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:36,499
Pieces of you get chipped away.

402
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:40,598
Could you bring back a man without a head?

403
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:43,746
Not six times.

404
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,901
Just once.

405
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:49,276
I don't think it works that way, child.

406
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:56,527
He was a good man, Ned Stark.

407
00:29:57,687 --> 00:30:00,634
He's at rest now, somewhere.

408
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,390
I would never wish my life upon him.

409
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:05,272
I would.

410
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:09,941
You're alive.

411
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:18,121
Lord, cast your light upon me.

412
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:21,687
Protect me in the darkness.

413
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,279
Burn away my sins.

414
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:28,756
Help me serve you.

415
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,978
Use me as you will.

416
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,378
For the night is dark

417
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:38,923
and full of terrors.

418
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:53,567
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

419
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:56,450
My lady.

420
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:58,988
I meant to come sooner.

421
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:02,705
- The battle...
- I know of your troubles, my king.

422
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:05,856
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

423
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:08,116
Yes, of course.

424
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:19,219
You mustn't despair.

425
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,493
Yur claim is true. You will be victorious.

426
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:26,378
- I believed that once.
- You are the one god's champion

427
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:29,397
and the finest man I've ever known.

428
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:35,731
I've broken a sacred vow.

429
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:41,589
I've sinned.
- No.

430
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,513
I've wronged you.

431
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,419
I have shamed you.

432
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:49,041
- You're doing god's work.
- You don't understand.

433
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,913
The Red Woman...

434
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,843
the Lady Melisandre...
- I know, Stannis.

435
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:06,326
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

436
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:11,286
No act done in service of the Lord of Light
can ever be a sin.

437
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:15,040
When she told me,

438
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,655
I wept...

439
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:20,388
with joy.

440
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,217
Oh, my sweet boys.

441
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:46,569
I thank god every day

442
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,138
for bringing Melisandre to us.

443
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:51,823
She gave you a son.

444
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,627
I gave you...

445
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,933
- nothing.
- That's not true.

446
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:07,149
So you've come to see her as well?

447
00:33:09,548 --> 00:33:11,379
There is no need.

448
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:15,713
You must keep away from such distractions.

449
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:17,251
She's my daughter.

450
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,870
I want to see her.

451
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,062
You are a king.

452
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,384
You don't need my permission.

453
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:56,008
Father!

454
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:06,964
You've grown since I last saw you.

455
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,886
Mother said you fought in a battle.

456
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:11,795
Did you win?

457
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,385
No.

458
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,184
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

459
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,169
He did.

460
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,909
He fought bravely.

461
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:24,700
He hasn't come to visit me.

462
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:27,637
He said he'd bring me back a
present from the capital.

463
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,375
He won't be visiting, child.

464
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:32,375
Why not? He's my friend.
Look.

465
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,001
He made this for me.

466
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,251
But don't tell Mother I have it.

467
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:46,921
It's a secret.

468
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,717
Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

469
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:54,514
Ser Davos is a traitor.

470
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:59,559
He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.

471
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:10,743
Best forget him.

472
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:25,436
Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

473
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:27,830
- What are you doing here?
- I need a bath.

474
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:31,185
Help me out of these rags.

475
00:35:37,991 --> 00:35:39,650
Now get out.

476
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,709
There's another tub.

477
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:57,678
This one suits me fine.

478
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,733
Don't worry. I'm not interested.

479
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,731
If I faint, pull me out.

480
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:21,324
I don't intend to be the first
Lannister to die in a bathtub.

481
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:25,602
- Why should I care how you die?
- You swore a solemn vow, remember?

482
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:29,863
You're supposed to get me to
King's Landing in one piece.

483
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:33,284
Not going so well, is it?

484
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:36,999
No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.

485
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,300
That was unworthy. Forgive me.

486
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:50,947
You protected me better than most...
- Don't you mock me.

487
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:52,532
I'm apologizing.

488
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,339
I'm sick of fighting.

489
00:36:56,844 --> 00:37:00,502
Let's call a truce.
- You need trust to have a truce.

490
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,104
I trust you.

491
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,850
There it is. There's the look.

492
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,817
I've seen it for 17 years
on face after face.

493
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,584
You all despise me.

494
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,454
Kingslayer.

495
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:24,399
Oathbreaker.

496
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:27,658
A man without honor.

497
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,683
You've heard of wildfire?

498
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,413
- Of course.
- The Mad King was obsessed with it.

499
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,641
He loved to watch people burn,

500
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:45,237
the way their skin blackened and blistered

501
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,202
and melted off their bones.

502
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:49,331
He burned lords he didn't like.

503
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:52,669
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.
He burned...

504
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:54,957
anyone who was against him.

505
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:59,876
Before long, half the country was against him.

506
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:05,111
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.

507
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:10,852
So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire

508
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,919
all over the city.

509
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:15,337
Beneath the Sept of Baelor

510
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,745
and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under...

511
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:20,496
houses, stables, taverns.

512
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:23,546
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

513
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,810
Finally,

514
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,741
the day of reckoning came.

515
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:35,644
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital
after his victory at the Trident.

516
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:38,104
But my father arrived first

517
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:41,055
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

518
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,402
promising...

519
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:45,099
to defend the city against the rebels.

520
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:49,658
I knew my father better than that.

521
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,806
He's never been one to pick the losing side.

522
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:54,894
I told the Mad King as much.

523
00:38:55,651 --> 00:38:58,430
I urged him to surrender peacefully.

524
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,431
But the king didn't listen to me.

525
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:05,226
He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.

526
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:06,456
But he did listen

527
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:08,681
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

528
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,920
that grey, sunken cunt.

529
00:39:13,649 --> 00:39:16,039
"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.

530
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:20,498
"The Lannisters have always been

531
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:22,457
true friends of the crown. "

532
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:26,123
So...

533
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:29,499
we opened the gates
and my father sacked the city.

534
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,028
Once again, I came to the king,

535
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:34,804
begging him...

536
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:36,236
to surrender.

537
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,627
He told me to...

538
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,946
bring him my father's head.

539
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,721
Then he...

540
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,880
turned to his pyromancer.

541
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:53,782
"Burn them all," he said.

542
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:56,703
"Burn them in...

543
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,205
their homes. Burn them in their beds. "

544
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:03,011
Tell me,

545
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:05,460
if your precious Renly

546
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:09,588
commanded you to kill your own father

547
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:12,542
and stand by while thousands of men,

548
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:16,539
women, and children burned alive,
would you have done it?

549
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:20,770
Would you have kept your oath then?

550
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:25,076
First, I...

551
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:28,165
killed the pyromancer. And then...

552
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:31,081
when the king turned to flee,

553
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:34,216
I drove my sword into his back.

554
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,616
"Burn them all," he kept saying.

555
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:39,684
"Burn them all. "

556
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:42,736
I don't think he expected to die. He...

557
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:45,353
He meant to...

558
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:49,169
burn with the rest of us

559
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:51,296
and rise again,

560
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:55,731
reborn as a dragon
to turn his enemies to ash.

561
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:03,159
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

562
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,773
That's where Ned Stark found me.

563
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:13,806
If this is true...

564
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:17,154
why didn't you tell anyone?

565
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:20,622
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

566
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:21,652
Stark?

567
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:23,398
You think

568
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:26,134
the honorable...

569
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:28,651
Ned Stark

570
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:32,210
wanted to hear my side?

571
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,242
He judged me

572
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:36,720
guilty the moment he set eyes on me.

573
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:43,092
By what right

574
00:41:43,188 --> 00:41:44,188
does the wolf

575
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:45,839
judge the lion?

576
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:49,353
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

577
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:50,983
The Kingslayer!

578
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:55,515
My name is Jaime.

579
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:01,527
<i>Onion Knight.</i>

580
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:03,793
<i>Ser Onion Knight.</i>

581
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:05,973
Princess?

582
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:07,973
Gods, what are you doing here?

583
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:09,936
- You'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

584
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:12,936
He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.

585
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,194
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

586
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:17,818
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

587
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:20,658
- If your father knew...
- He said you were a traitor.

588
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:21,688
Are you?

589
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:23,946
I am, child.

590
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,292
I disobeyed my king, your father, and now...

591
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:28,972
I'm paying the price.

592
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,321
I don't care. You're my friend.

593
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:33,034
You must get bored down here.

594
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:35,021
I brought you something to read.

595
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:37,251
It's about Aegon and his dragons.

596
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,831
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?

597
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:41,897
<i>- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.</i>

598
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,819
- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.

599
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:46,911
It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

600
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,861
Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book,

601
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:51,905
but it's wasted on me.
- Take it.

602
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,085
I have more.

603
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,757
My lady, I can't read the words.

604
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,660
You can't?

605
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:02,053
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

606
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,184
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

607
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,264
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

608
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,940
What will they do, lock us in cells?

609
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:16,833
I wouldn't know where to start.

610
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,963
At the beginning.

611
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,703
This word is Aegon.

612
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:23,268
When you see A, E, and G

613
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:25,216
together like that,

614
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:26,946
it sounds like egg.

615
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:28,817
And the title of the whole book

616
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:30,913
<i>is "An History of Aegon the Conqueror</i>

617
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,891
<i>and His Conquest of Westeros. "</i>

618
00:43:45,428 --> 00:43:47,001
It was a bitch of a siege.

619
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:49,475
You were first through the breach at Pyke?

620
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:50,555
The second.

621
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:52,569
Thoros of Myr went in alone,

622
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:54,928
waving that flaming sword of his.

623
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:57,692
Bloody madman.

624
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:00,472
Robert knighted you after the battle?

625
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:02,618
Proudest moment of my life.

626
00:44:02,648 --> 00:44:05,651
One knee in the dust,
the king's sword on my shoulder,

627
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:06,898
listening to the words.

628
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:10,189
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave. "

629
00:44:11,186 --> 00:44:15,069
All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.

630
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:17,748
In full plate metal for 16 hours.

631
00:44:17,778 --> 00:44:19,718
Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.

632
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:21,890
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss

633
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,812
on the king's boots.

634
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,390
Robert would have laughed.

635
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,500
He was a good man,

636
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,987
a great warrior.

637
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:33,459
And a terrible king.

638
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:36,718
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

639
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:38,594
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

640
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:40,765
And a man of honor keeps his vows,

641
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:43,643
even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.

642
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:46,495
Just once in my life before it's over,

643
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:49,681
I want to know what it's like
to serve with pride,

644
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,951
to fight for someone I believe in.

645
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:54,005
Do you believe in her?

646
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,003
With all my heart.

647
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,313
- These are the ones?
- Yes, khaleesi. The officers.

648
00:45:43,745 --> 00:45:47,480
All Unsullied boys are given new names
when they are cut.

649
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,022
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

650
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:52,774
Names that remind them what they are...

651
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:55,540
vermin.

652
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:44,598
<i>King Robert wanted her dead.</i>

653
00:46:44,628 --> 00:46:48,390
Of course he wanted her dead.
She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

654
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,235
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

655
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:54,900
- I didn't sit on the small council.
- No?

656
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:58,848
Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
traditionally... - Traditionally, yes...

657
00:46:58,878 --> 00:47:02,770
but I killed a dozen
of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

658
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:08,139
He didn't want advice on how to govern
from a man who had fought for the Mad King.

659
00:47:08,169 --> 00:47:10,148
Can't say I minded much.

660
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:12,784
I always hated the politics.

661
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:15,118
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

662
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:19,778
Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings
and betrayals the world over.

663
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:27,989
Still, she'll have to wade through that muck
if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

664
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:31,819
She'll have good men around her to advise her,
men with experience.

665
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,686
- Which men do you have in mind?
- Forgive me for what I'm about to say,

666
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:39,273
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

667
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:40,948
It suffered for a reason.

668
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,125
I sold men into slavery.

669
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:45,025
I don't know if your presence by her side

670
00:47:45,055 --> 00:47:47,191
will help our cause when we go home.

671
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,611
Our cause?

672
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:53,138
Forgive me, but I was busy defending the khaleesi
against King Robert's assassins

673
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:55,224
while you were still bowing to the man.

674
00:47:55,254 --> 00:47:58,335
We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

675
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,733
You only joined us a few days ago.

676
00:48:00,763 --> 00:48:02,591
I can't speak to your intentions.

677
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,967
If we're truly her loyal servants,

678
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,651
we will do whatever needs to be done,

679
00:48:08,058 --> 00:48:10,388
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

680
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:12,779
You're not Lord Commander here.

681
00:48:13,316 --> 00:48:15,265
You're just another exile.

682
00:48:15,939 --> 00:48:18,345
And I take my orders from the queen.

683
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:28,628
- Come to bed.
- You were right.

684
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:31,951
The Karstarks are gone.

685
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,607
Almost half our forces.

686
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:38,427
Tywin Lannister knows what he
needs to do to make us unravel.

687
00:48:39,482 --> 00:48:40,913
Nothing.

688
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,076
Only wait.

689
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,293
Don't let him.

690
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,669
What can I do?

691
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:50,244
Attack King's Landing?

692
00:48:50,274 --> 00:48:51,787
There's nothing he'd like better.

693
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:54,290
He'd crush us in a day.

694
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:56,831
We could ride north.

695
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:58,811
Take your land back from the Greyjoys.

696
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:02,134
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last five years.

697
00:49:02,164 --> 00:49:06,413
Once my bannermen are home again,
sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families,

698
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,217
warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.

699
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:13,460
When I gathered my lords together,
we had a purpose, a mission.

700
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,475
Now we're like a band of bickering children.

701
00:49:18,676 --> 00:49:20,397
Give them a new purpose.

702
00:49:20,701 --> 00:49:21,889
What?

703
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:28,101
I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

704
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:32,535
Here.

705
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:40,052
And we're here. King's Landing...

706
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,335
What is it?

707
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:54,817
I can't force them to meet us in the field

708
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:57,678
and I can't attack them where they're strongest,

709
00:49:57,937 --> 00:50:00,313
but I can attack them where they're not.

710
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:03,571
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

711
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:08,324
I'm going to take their home away from them.

712
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:11,528
Can you do it?

713
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:15,678
I need men to replace the
Karstarks who marched home.

714
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:18,508
There is only one person in this kingdom
with that kind of army

715
00:50:18,538 --> 00:50:21,160
who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.

716
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,298
The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry.

717
00:50:37,087 --> 00:50:39,196
He's such a splendid fighter.

718
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:42,691
Do you have any idea when we might...

719
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:45,985
I'll plant the seed as soon
as Joffrey and I are married.

720
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:49,080
It should grow quickly.
- Joffrey won't let me leave.

721
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,790
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

722
00:50:52,312 --> 00:50:54,551
And only one to let you go.

723
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:57,848
Because it will please me.

724
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,386
<i>Squire!</i>

725
00:51:03,418 --> 00:51:04,879
Well fought, ser.

726
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:06,658
That was no fight.

727
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:09,992
- I don't know you.
- Olyver, if it please you.

728
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:16,600
I should like to see you spar
with a proper partner, ser.

729
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:26,230
- How did you know?
- Know what?

730
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:30,847
- That I wanted to.
- My lord...

731
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,440
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon
and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.

732
00:51:40,818 --> 00:51:43,623
They rarely do, in my experience.

733
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:46,426
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

734
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,943
With the husbands.

735
00:51:58,227 --> 00:52:00,008
That didn't take long.

736
00:52:00,923 --> 00:52:02,684
Well, it took long enough.

737
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:07,397
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

738
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:08,429
Is he?

739
00:52:09,216 --> 00:52:10,216
And...

740
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:12,673
who's the lucky girl?

741
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:16,085
She may not be the grandest ship in the world

742
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:18,375
or the fastest,

743
00:52:20,045 --> 00:52:21,346
but she's mine.

744
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:26,916
I've always wanted a ship.

745
00:52:26,946 --> 00:52:28,577
Now I want a dozen.

746
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,661
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

747
00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:33,998
It doesn't matter what we want,

748
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,498
once we get it,

749
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,539
then we want something else.

750
00:52:40,387 --> 00:52:41,627
Your hair is different.

751
00:52:42,064 --> 00:52:44,260
Is it?

752
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:49,336
Lady Margaery wears it that way.
- Many ladies wear it this way.

753
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,579
I have good news.
I'll be leaving the city soon.

754
00:52:52,945 --> 00:52:56,320
- You still want me to come with you?
- It's not a question of what I want.

755
00:52:56,626 --> 00:52:58,518
It's what you want.

756
00:52:58,753 --> 00:53:02,688
- You want to go home, don't you?
- Of course. More than anything.

757
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,575
But maybe it would be better to wait.

758
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:11,170
I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.

759
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,135
Not just for me, but for you.

760
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,932
You've been so kind.
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.

761
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:21,338
I can't tell you how touched I am

762
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:23,808
by your concern for my welfare.

763
00:53:25,028 --> 00:53:27,746
I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.

764
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,615
Your true friend.

765
00:53:30,116 --> 00:53:31,486
I do, Lord Baelish.

766
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:35,997
If you wish to stay,

767
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:38,648
then of course you will stay.

768
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,146
We'll speak again when I return.

769
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:00,911
<i>You're late.</i>

770
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:03,990
What's she doing here?

771
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:06,700
Our business concerns her, too.

772
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:07,914
Sit.

773
00:54:10,423 --> 00:54:15,238
You'll be pleased to learn
that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,

774
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,031
I've saved the crown
hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

775
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:22,845
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.

776
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:26,087
I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.

777
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:27,439
Stop that.

778
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,407
You're making me uncomfortable.

779
00:54:29,442 --> 00:54:32,607
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

780
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:35,449
are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

781
00:54:35,959 --> 00:54:36,959
Very well.

782
00:54:37,305 --> 00:54:38,892
She's a lovely girl.

783
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:43,194
Missing some of Loras' favorite bits,
but I'm sure they'll make do.

784
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:45,875
- Your jokes are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but...

785
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:49,024
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

786
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:52,399
by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.

787
00:54:52,433 --> 00:54:54,259
Sansa is the key to the North?

788
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,392
I seem to remember she has an older brother.

789
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:58,465
The Karstarks have marched home.

790
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,956
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

791
00:55:01,986 --> 00:55:04,645
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

792
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:07,602
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.

793
00:55:08,508 --> 00:55:11,793
And I am not about to hand
her over to the Tyrells.

794
00:55:11,823 --> 00:55:14,726
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.

795
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:16,824
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

796
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:19,007
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

797
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,621
Plots are not public knowledge.

798
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:25,667
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.

799
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,471
We need to act first and
kill this union in its crib.

800
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,906
And how do we do that?

801
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,212
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

802
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:35,392
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

803
00:55:43,746 --> 00:55:46,613
- You can't mean it.
- I can and I do.

804
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,780
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable since

805
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,130
the day he took her father's head.

806
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,766
Now she's finally free of
him and you give her to me?

807
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:58,354
That's cruel even for you.
- Do you intend on mistreating her?

808
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:01,431
The girl's happiness is not my concern,
nor should it be yours.

809
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:02,749
She's a child!

810
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,647
She's flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed it at length.

811
00:56:05,677 --> 00:56:09,264
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

812
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,908
- Surely you're capable of that.
- And if I refuse?

813
00:56:11,938 --> 00:56:15,042
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

814
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:18,659
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

815
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,425
And it is past time you were wed.

816
00:56:21,554 --> 00:56:22,900
I was wed.

817
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:25,773
Or don't you remember?

818
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,162
Only too well.

819
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:33,507
You should be thanking the gods for this.

820
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:35,385
This is more than you deserve.

821
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:37,809
Tyrion will do as he's bid.

822
00:56:38,724 --> 00:56:39,833
As will you.

823
00:56:41,843 --> 00:56:42,952
What do you mean?

824
00:56:43,677 --> 00:56:45,134
You'll marry Ser Loras.

825
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,298
- I will not.
- The boy is heir to Highgarden.

826
00:56:50,328 --> 00:56:52,831
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

827
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:55,101
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

828
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:58,272
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

829
00:56:58,302 --> 00:57:00,364
I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.

830
00:57:00,394 --> 00:57:01,753
You're my daughter!

831
00:57:03,248 --> 00:57:04,565
You will do as I command

832
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,755
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

833
00:57:07,454 --> 00:57:11,783
and put an end to the disgusting rumors
about you once and for all.

834
00:57:12,114 --> 00:57:14,188
Father, don't make me do it again, please.

835
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:15,588
Not another word.

836
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,482
My children.

837
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:23,321
You've disgraced the Lannister
name for far too long.

838
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:27,845
