1
00:00:01,288 --> 00:00:03,944
<i>The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
- How?!</i>

2
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:06,409
Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.

3
00:00:06,444 --> 00:00:09,216
<i>Returning him may buy life for my children.</i>

4
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:12,282
Ser Barristan Selmy,
it is time to put aside your sword.

5
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,486
You're too old to protect anyone.

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:19,157
Even now I could cut through the
five of you like carving a cake.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,086
Here, boy.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,823
Melt it down and add it to the others.

9
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:26,459
Where are my dragons?!

10
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,795
<i>I will take you to the House of the Undying</i>

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,069
where I have put them.

12
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:33,096
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

13
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,332
<i>I love her.</i>

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,037
The Iron Throne is mine.

15
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,268
No one wants you for their king.

16
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,048
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

17
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:43,009
<i>The night is dark and full of terrors.</i>

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,583
If Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

19
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:48,380
<i>- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be the queen.</i>

20
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,048
<i>Mance is gonna march on the Wall.</i>

21
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,751
<i>One brother inside his army</i>

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,419
<i>will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.</i>

23
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,354
<i>- They'll never trust me.
- They might...</i>

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,424
<i>if you do what needs to be done.</i>

25
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>Come along, Jon Snow.</i>

26
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,696
Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

27
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,132
<i>Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.</i>

28
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,358
Dracarys.

29
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,839
When I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.

30
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:13,340
I pray I serve you well.

31
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,100
I expect you'll be the first
crabber's son to wear the badge.

32
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:28,624
The battle is over. We have won.

33
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:31,894
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

34
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,965
If it weren't for your squire's
bravery you'd be a dead man.

35
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,390
Ser Loras Tyrell, I will
gladly wed your sweet sister.

36
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,573
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

37
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,275
This war has just begun.

38
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,043
You will be king.

39
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,553
It's Jon and the Halfhand.

40
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,595
Two blasts is wildlings.

41
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,620
Run!

42
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,413
Brother?

43
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,744
Did you send the ravens?

44
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,151
Tarly...

45
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:32,977
Look at me.

46
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,794
Did you send the ravens?

47
00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:43,909
That was your job.

48
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,720
Your only job.

49
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:56,960
We need to get back to the Wall.

50
00:04:58,418 --> 00:04:59,910
It's a long march.

51
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,726
We know what's out there,

52
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,660
but we have to make it, have to warn them

53
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,801
or before winter's done,

54
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,605
everyone you've ever known

55
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:13,777
will be dead.

60
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,617
First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?

61
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,755
Well, don't stare too long. They're shy.

62
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,832
When they stop being shy, they get angry.

63
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:23,007
And when they're angry,

64
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:26,320
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

65
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,155
like a hammer on a nail.

66
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,230
<i>- Crow!
- Crow!</i>

67
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:42,581
<i>- Look over there!
- Crow!</i>

68
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,654
<i>Crow! Look over here! Look!</i>

69
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,164
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

70
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:51,345
<i>Crow!</i>

71
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,634
You're wearing the wrong color.

72
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,789
Mance was a ranger.

73
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,718
In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.

74
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,784
When I'm free, will I be free to go?

75
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,167
- Crow!
- Crow!

76
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,367
Sure, you will.

77
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,679
And I'll be free to kill you.

78
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,861
Got no respect, this lot.

79
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:21,485
Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.

80
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:23,363
What happened to their fathers?

81
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,881
Some of them were killed by crows like you.

82
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,619
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

83
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,512
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

84
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,123
And if he don't...

85
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,394
I smell a crow.

86
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:04,227
We killed his friends.

87
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,640
Thought you'd want to question this one.

88
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,569
What do we want with a baby crow?

89
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:12,410
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.

90
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,943
He wants to be one of us.

91
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:24,749
That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine.

92
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,719
Friends twice your size.

93
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:32,786
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

94
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,255
if you put a sword through their hearts.

95
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,666
Plenty of little men

96
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:42,065
tried to put their swords through my heart.

97
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,580
And there's plenty of little skeletons

98
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,219
buried in the woods.

99
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:51,047
- What's your name, boy?
- Jon Snow.

100
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,172
Your Grace.

101
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:03,409
Your Grace?

102
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,488
Did you hear that?

103
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:10,283
From now on,
you'd better kneel every time I fart.

104
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,187
Stand, boy.

105
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:17,875
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.

106
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,746
So...

107
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,780
you're Ned Stark's bastard.

108
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,941
Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones.

109
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,333
You can leave us.

110
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,709
The girl likes you.

111
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:42,850
You like her back, Snow?

112
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,644
That why you want to join us?

113
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,449
Don't panic, boy.

114
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,534
This isn't the damned Night's Watch

115
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:52,151
where we make you swear off girls.

116
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,810
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

117
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,160
Can't believe this pup
killed the Halfhand.

118
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,880
He was our enemy

119
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,626
and I'm glad he's dead.

120
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:17,584
He was my brother once.

121
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:20,278
Back when he had a whole hand.

122
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,828
What were you doing with him?

123
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,354
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

124
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:28,433
Why?

125
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,888
He wants me to lead one day.
- But here you are...

126
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,281
a traitor...

127
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,338
kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.

128
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:38,922
If I'm a traitor...

129
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,310
then you are, too.

130
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,745
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?

131
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:58,841
I want to be free.

132
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:00,291
No

133
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,188
I don't think so.

134
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:07,391
I think what you want most of all
is to be a hero.

135
00:13:08,713 --> 00:13:10,948
I'll ask you one last time...

136
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:14,108
why do you want to join us?

137
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:22,922
We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.

138
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:25,478
I saw...

139
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:28,427
You saw what?

140
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:34,361
I saw Craster take his own baby boy
and leave it in the woods.

141
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:37,510
I saw what took it.

142
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:45,172
You're telling me you saw one of them?

143
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:51,446
And why would that make you desert your brothers?

144
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:54,194
Because when I told the Lord Commander,

145
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,058
he already knew.

146
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,477
Thousands of years ago,

147
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:02,990
the First Men battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

148
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:08,037
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

149
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:13,309
Did I come to the right place?

150
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:20,849
We'll need to find you a new cloak.

151
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,173
What if you took off that bit there?

152
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,912
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

153
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:54,132
Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.

154
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,020
I want you to take it off.

155
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:06,989
Mouth.

156
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:14,595
<i>Ser Bronn.</i>

157
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:15,956
<i>Ser Bronn.</i>

158
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,453
I didn't hear that.

159
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,974
- Apologies, ser.
- Back away.

160
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,291
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment. Then back away some more.

161
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,514
Lord Tyrion sent me.

162
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:30,833
I will murder you, boy.

163
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:34,269
He said it was a matter of life and death.

164
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,109
Pod?

165
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,396
It's your sister.

166
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,081
<i>The queen.</i>

167
00:16:10,423 --> 00:16:11,590
What are they doing here?

168
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,239
Protecting me, I assume.

169
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,526
Will you let me in?

170
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,868
No, I don't think so.

171
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:22,301
If I wanted to kill you, do you think
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

172
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:31,986
- They stay outside.
- I'm not afraid of you, little brother.

173
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:49,956
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

174
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:54,465
They said you'd lost your nose,
but it's not as gruesome as all that.

175
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,335
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

176
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:58,993
I should hope so.

177
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,204
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

178
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,835
Thanks to Father.

179
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,921
Thanks to Father.

180
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,297
Of course,
it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.

181
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,117
No? Curious.

182
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:17,290
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.

183
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,262
But then I don't suppose you need much room.

184
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,804
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.

185
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,292
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

186
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:28,172
You're meeting Father today?

187
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,409
How do you know that?

188
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,275
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.

189
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,811
The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.

190
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:41,214
Father told me. What do you want from him?

191
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,237
What do I want from him? He's my father.

192
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:44,817
Do I need to want something?

193
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,328
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

194
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:53,467
as any father loves his child,
his baby boy.

195
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:58,535
Yet he hasn't come to visit once
since arriving in King's Landing.

196
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:01,667
I lay here, my face split in half,

197
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,465
but Father never came.

198
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:11,270
You're going to make me cry.

199
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:14,236
Why do you care what I want from him?

200
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,565
Because you've slandered me to Father before.

201
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,592
Slandered? When?

202
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:23,831
You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

203
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,735
You did have your guards beat her.

204
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:29,030
A girl of nine, I believe.
- I was nine, too.

205
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,989
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

206
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,898
If I remember correctly,
she never stole a necklace again.

207
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,245
It's not slander if it's true.

208
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:42,080
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

209
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:45,943
Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?

210
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:47,531
Because you're a liar.

211
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,482
I expect you'll tell lies about me,
about Joffrey.

212
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:53,985
Any lies in particular?

213
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,088
You're a clever man,

214
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,459
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

215
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,548
Still makes me more clever than you.

216
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:10,336
Oh, look at these two shining warriors.

217
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:13,839
Ser Taryn Mant and...

218
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,312
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

219
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:17,009
Ser Meryn Trant.

220
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:19,129
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

221
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,663
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

222
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:25,477
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
was anointed by the king himself.

223
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:28,354
You're an up-jumped cutthroat,

224
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
nothing more.

225
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,578
That's exactly who I am.

226
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,965
And you're a grub in fancy armor

227
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:37,068
who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.

228
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,274
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

229
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,242
You put your hand on that door,

230
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,248
you lose the hand.

231
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,896
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

232
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,626
I am wondering why you sent for me.

233
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:07,852
A number of people in this city want to kill me.

234
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:09,932
You're here to protect me.

235
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:11,686
I've been doing that for a while now.

236
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:13,286
Do you grow bored protecting me?

237
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,992
- I grow poor protecting you.
- Poor?

238
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:17,149
Poor...

239
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,919
Under my patronage you've become a knight,
you've served as Commander of the City Watch.

240
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:21,949
Briefly.

241
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,786
I'm sure you filled your pockets.

242
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,974
And now my pockets are empty.

243
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:28,279
You've given me a taste for the finer things.

244
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,694
And if you want me to carry on protecting you,
you'll need to pay more.

245
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:33,049
I thought we were friends.

246
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,179
We are.

247
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:37,004
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.

248
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:39,586
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
- How much?

249
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:40,934
- Double.
- Double?

250
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,537
I'm a knight now.

251
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:46,435
Knights are worth double.
- I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.

252
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,165
Which means you can afford it.

253
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,348
Here. Here!

254
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,173
Help me!

255
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:03,703
Who are you?

256
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,627
I was in the battle...

257
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,089
at Blackwater.

258
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,215
I was a captain...

259
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,452
and a knight.

260
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:16,641
Aye ser...

261
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,932
and serving which king?

262
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,820
The one true king of Westeros...

263
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:31,897
Stannis Baratheon.

264
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,419
I thought you were dead.

265
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,043
Everyone thought you were dead.

266
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,960
And your son?

267
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,456
He may have swam ashore as you did.

268
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:03,336
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

269
00:23:12,912 --> 00:23:14,862
I'm so sorry, my friend.

270
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,061
I, too, have lost a son.

271
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:21,106
There is nothing worse in this world.

272
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:23,853
But, Davos...

273
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:26,343
you were a good father.

274
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:29,917
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

275
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,057
Stannis lives?

276
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,105
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

277
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:37,785
Will you take me there?

278
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,972
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

279
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,844
This war is not over.

280
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:43,179
Not for you, maybe.

281
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,909
But for Salladhor Saan

282
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:46,618
the war is over.

283
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:50,539
- We're both sworn to King Stannis.
- I am sworn to no man.

284
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,312
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

285
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:55,863
I delivered the ships.

286
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,069
Stannis never gives up. Never.

287
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:00,539
- Now he will regroup...
- He's a broken man.

288
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,300
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

289
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,926
They say he sees no one...
not his generals, not even his wife.

290
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:08,656
Only the Red Woman

291
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:14,534
whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames

292
00:24:14,564 --> 00:24:16,287
and burning men alive.

293
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:18,258
- What?
- They built a great fire

294
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,088
when Stannis returned.

295
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,956
All those who spoke against her she called

296
00:24:23,986 --> 00:24:26,119
servants of darkness.

297
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,559
They say she sang to them as they burned.

298
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:37,364
I'm a pirate.

299
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,559
You're a smuggler.

300
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,610
Servants of darkness.

301
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:45,215
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

302
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:47,145
Take me back there, please.

303
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,100
You cannot turn Stannis against her.

304
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,520
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

305
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,200
You could try.

306
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:55,957
If you fail, they will burn you.

307
00:24:55,987 --> 00:24:58,705
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

308
00:24:58,735 --> 00:25:00,685
And you've only just come back to life.

309
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:03,267
Stay alive a little longer, my friend.

310
00:25:03,297 --> 00:25:05,877
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.

311
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,332
And you drank with me on four of my wedding days,

312
00:25:08,362 --> 00:25:10,101
but I don't ask you for favors.

313
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:11,493
I have to stop her.

314
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,650
Please.

315
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,537
Do this for me.

316
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:19,596
When you are dead,

317
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:22,809
I will gather your bones in a little sack

318
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,171
and let your widow...

319
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:26,251
wear them around her neck.

320
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:42,082
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

321
00:25:42,112 --> 00:25:44,786
There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

322
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:48,170
I imagine the Mountain will defend
whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.

323
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,679
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

324
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,085
I'd love a fight.

325
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,415
The men would love a fight.

326
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:56,804
I don't think we're going to get one.

327
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:45,951
200 Northmen

328
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:47,922
slaughtered like sheep.

329
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:51,621
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

330
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,925
For them and for your sons.

331
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:55,813
Will it?

332
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:58,575
They rot in the ground

333
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:01,373
while their killer runs free.

334
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:04,318
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.

335
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,348
My best hunters are after him.

336
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:26,987
A Mallister?

337
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:28,846
Ser Jeremy.

338
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,255
My father's bannerman.

339
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:55,685
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.

340
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:09,220
She's your mother.

341
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,968
She freed Jaime Lannister.

342
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:14,236
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons

343
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:16,636
and she robbed them of their justice.

344
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:19,361
Water.

345
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:22,795
Water.

346
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:25,411
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

347
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,000
What's your name, friend?

348
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,528
Qyburn.

349
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:36,004
You're lucky to be alive.

350
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:39,829
Lucky?

351
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:09,303
The badge looks good on you.

352
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,324
Almost as good as it looked on me.

353
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:18,446
Are you enjoying your new position?

354
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:21,939
Am I enjoying it?

355
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,668
I was very happy as Hand of the King.

356
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:26,562
Yes.

357
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,636
I heard how happy you were.

358
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,296
You brought a whore into my bed.

359
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,948
It wasn't your bed at the time.

360
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,126
I sent you here to advise the king.

361
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:44,771
I gave you real power and authority.

362
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,525
You chose to spend your days
as you always have,

363
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,432
bedding harlots

364
00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:54,789
and drinking with thieves.

365
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:59,422
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

366
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:01,365
What do you want, Tyrion?

367
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:04,151
Why does everyone assume I want something?

368
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,738
Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?

369
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:10,403
My beloved father who

370
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,840
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son
after he fell on the battlefield.

371
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,584
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

372
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:22,114
I organized the defense of this city

373
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,910
while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.

374
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,501
I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate

375
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:30,832
while your grandson, the king,

376
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,700
quivered in fear behind the walls.

377
00:30:34,253 --> 00:30:37,362
I bled in the mud for our family.

378
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,490
And as my reward,

379
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,493
I was trundled off to some dark little cell.

380
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:44,843
But what do I want?

381
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:48,824
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

382
00:30:48,854 --> 00:30:52,124
Jugglers and singers require applause.

383
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,020
You are a Lannister.

384
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:59,966
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses
every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?

385
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:05,664
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after

386
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:09,281
and three of them are in open rebellion. So...

387
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,871
tell me what you want.

388
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:19,579
I want what is mine by right.

389
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,325
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

390
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:29,169
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

391
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:31,591
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,

392
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:34,366
he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

393
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:37,834
I am your son and lawful heir.

394
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:42,616
You want Casterly Rock?

395
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:44,539
It is mine by right.

396
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:53,380
We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name

397
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:58,288
and as a reward for your accomplishments
during the battle of Blackwater Bay.

398
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:04,314
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position fit for your talents

399
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,689
so that you can serve your family

400
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,567
and protect our legacy.
And if you serve faithfully,

401
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,385
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

402
00:32:14,354 --> 00:32:18,340
And I would let myself be consumed by maggots
before mocking the family name

403
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,944
and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

404
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:24,992
- Why?
- Why?

405
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,274
You ask that?

406
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:31,221
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

407
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,123
You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature

408
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,161
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

409
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,650
Men's laws give you the right to bear my name

410
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,833
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

411
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:50,814
And to teach me humility,
the gods have condemned me

412
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:54,141
to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion

413
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:57,846
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

414
00:32:58,305 --> 00:32:59,957
But neither gods nor men

415
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:04,613
will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock
into your whorehouse.

416
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,969
Go, now.

417
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,463
Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.

418
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:18,923
Go.

419
00:33:28,992 --> 00:33:30,777
Oh, one more thing.

420
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:36,546
The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.

421
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:45,640
<i>Dorne.</i>

422
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,420
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

423
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,180
- Why Dorne?
- It's carrying silk

424
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,297
and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.

425
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:59,874
But it's not coming back.

426
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,685
The captain's tired of risking his life

427
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,916
so King's Landing lords and ladies

428
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:08,099
can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.

429
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,054
He's going to stay in Dorne.

430
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:14,303
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.

431
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,939
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

432
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,513
Don't ruin the game.

433
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,579
I told you, I don't want to play.

434
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:26,350
What about that one there?

435
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:27,837
That one?

436
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:29,865
It's going to Volantis.

437
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:31,507
Why?

438
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:35,813
Because when I got on a ship in Volantis,
it looked like that one.

439
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:37,848
That's not how the game works.

440
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:40,838
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

441
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:45,329
You've got to invent a story
about where the ship is going and why.

442
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:49,590
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

443
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:54,141
Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.

444
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:55,324
Lovely day for it.

445
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:58,848
Watching the ships.

446
00:34:59,332 --> 00:35:00,445
Lord Baelish.

447
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:06,292
Might I speak with Lady Sansa
alone for a moment?

448
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,608
I saw your mother not long ago.

449
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:24,387
She's very eager to see you.

450
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:28,193
And your sister.

451
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:31,214
Arya's alive?

452
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,057
You said you'd take me home.

453
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:40,892
You said King's Landing was your home.

454
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:45,009
You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason.

455
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:47,978
If you were to tell just one person...
- I won't tell anyone.

456
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:51,235
- How do I know?
- Because I'm a terrible liar.

457
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:53,032
You said so yourself.

458
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:57,043
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

459
00:36:00,398 --> 00:36:04,498
I'm waiting for word on an assignment
that will take me far away from the capital.

460
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:09,105
When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.

461
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,486
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

462
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,366
You're her handmaiden?

463
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,467
Yes.

464
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:24,158
And you're his...?
- I help manage his affairs.

465
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,480
He's an important person.

466
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,719
So is she.

467
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,781
I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.

468
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:35,569
The day she was born, they rang the bells
from sunrise till sunset.

469
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:40,842
We've both done rather well, you and I.

470
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,827
Yes.

471
00:36:45,424 --> 00:36:47,577
Given where we started.

472
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,098
And where is that?

473
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,784
It's not easy for girls like us
to dig our way out.

474
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:02,746
Watch out for her.

475
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,628
I always do.

476
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,674
Watch out for her with him.

477
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,038
They're growing fast.

478
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:08,629
Not fast enough.

479
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:12,095
I can't wait that long.

480
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:16,922
I need an army.

481
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:20,315
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.

482
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:25,308
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

483
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:27,795
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.

484
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,088
The distinction means a good deal to some people.

485
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:34,184
Do those people have any better ideas
about how to put you on the Iron Throne?

486
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:39,451
It's too beautiful a day to argue.

487
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,629
You're right.

488
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:49,034
Another lovely day on the high seas.

489
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:50,840
Don't mock them.

490
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:53,461
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

491
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,900
They followed me across the poison water.

492
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,547
If they'll do it, others will.
And with a true khalasar...

493
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:01,777
The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi.

494
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:06,483
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

495
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:08,141
And not before.

496
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,273
Your Grace.

497
00:39:49,023 --> 00:39:50,871
I heard you were dead.

498
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:52,726
Not yet.

499
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:58,066
I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.

500
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:00,373
We are alone.

501
00:40:11,698 --> 00:40:13,900
Your Grace, you are the rightful king.

502
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:16,786
Not only by blood.

503
00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:20,605
You're an honorable man, a just man.

504
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,216
And there is still a war to fight.

505
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:24,442
I am fighting.

506
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,471
By burning prisoners alive?

507
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:32,141
How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?

508
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,833
I do not judge people for the gods they worship.

509
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:39,379
If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea
before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.

510
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,117
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

511
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:50,168
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?

512
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,000
Did I set your ships ablaze?

513
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,595
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

514
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:04,706
I could have saved those men.

515
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:08,494
You would have taken the city,
Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne,

516
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:10,374
and you would stand beside him.

517
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:12,504
But I wasn't there.

518
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:16,336
Because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

519
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,555
Do you hear them screaming?

520
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,636
All those burning men in the water

521
00:41:31,396 --> 00:41:33,096
crying for their mothers,

522
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:35,986
for their gods for help?

523
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:40,303
Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.

524
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:47,955
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

525
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,655
What I told your son is true.

526
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,324
Death by fire

527
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:55,238
is the purest death.

528
00:41:57,856 --> 00:41:59,565
This woman is evil!

529
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:01,045
She's the mother of demons.

530
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:03,484
Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.

531
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:04,937
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

532
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:08,048
- You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
- She will destroy us all!

533
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:09,428
I will pray for you.

534
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:11,316
<i>Your Grace!</i>

535
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:40,304
<i>Halt.</i>

536
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:41,704
<i>Down.</i>

537
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:43,786
<i>Halt.</i>

538
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:45,513
<i>Down.</i>

539
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:55,892
- Why have we stopped?
- It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

540
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:02,741
What is she doing? Who gave her permission?

541
00:43:02,771 --> 00:43:03,771
My lady.

542
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:06,284
We should have guards, my lady.

543
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:07,414
Why?

544
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:12,934
Pardon me.

545
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:21,615
Stop, my lady.

546
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:23,736
You'll ruin your dress.

547
00:43:24,156 --> 00:43:25,256
I have others.

548
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:33,674
Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?

549
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:38,093
No.

550
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:39,855
He was a soldier.

551
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,626
He went to fight on the walls

552
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:45,677
when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.

553
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,207
He never came back.

554
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:48,625
And your mother?

555
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:51,197
She died when she had me.

556
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:57,718
Bad men wanted to come into this city
and do terrible things,

557
00:43:57,748 --> 00:43:59,976
but your father stopped them.

558
00:44:06,496 --> 00:44:08,476
Whenever you look at this knight,

559
00:44:08,506 --> 00:44:10,906
I want you to remember your father.

560
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:15,345
He wasn't a knight.

561
00:44:15,847 --> 00:44:17,347
He was just a soldier.

562
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:20,324
And what do knights swear to do?

563
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:23,104
Protect the weak and uphold the good.

564
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:25,296
Your father did that.

565
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:27,195
Be proud of him.

566
00:44:30,158 --> 00:44:32,208
Was your father a soldier, too?

567
00:44:33,935 --> 00:44:36,035
You should be proud, too.

568
00:44:38,768 --> 00:44:40,959
Under King Joffrey's leadership,

569
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:43,748
your fathers saved the city.

570
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:46,065
They saved us all.

571
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:47,286
From now on...

572
00:44:47,577 --> 00:44:49,577
we're going to take care of you.

573
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:53,363
All of you.

574
00:45:01,136 --> 00:45:05,486
Come to me for whatever you need to feed them,
clothe them, or house them.

575
00:45:06,897 --> 00:45:08,347
Directly to me.

576
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,325
Your Grace.

577
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,468
- Your Grace.
- Please, sit. Sit.

578
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:29,748
I do apologize, my lady.

579
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:32,477
Small council meetings.

580
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:36,574
At what point does it become treason
to waste the king's time?

581
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:42,804
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

582
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:44,734
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

583
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,337
I imagine you might be rather cold.

584
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:50,976
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

585
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:53,606
Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?

586
00:45:54,058 --> 00:45:56,524
I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.

587
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:59,897
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

588
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,127
- Doesn't it, Loras?
- Yes.

589
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:05,497
Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?

590
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:08,087
The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.

591
00:46:08,117 --> 00:46:09,655
I've never seen anything like it.

592
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:11,844
You might find a bit of armor quite useful

593
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:14,724
once you become queen. Perhaps before.

594
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:18,145
Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom

595
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,355
on your way back from the sept this morning.

596
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:21,390
Yes.

597
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:25,936
I paid a visit to an orphanage
the High Septon told me about.

598
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:29,516
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

599
00:46:29,674 --> 00:46:33,307
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

600
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:35,237
and approach them with an open heart.

601
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:36,848
An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom

602
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,376
if you're not careful, my dear.

603
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:42,356
Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.

604
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:46,827
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

605
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:48,795
The king barely escaped with his life.

606
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:51,975
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.

607
00:46:52,736 --> 00:46:56,986
Facts become less and less important to her
as she grows older.

608
00:46:57,276 --> 00:47:00,326
Our lives were never truly in danger.

609
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:03,193
You're right, of course.

610
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,373
But you are your father's son.

611
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:09,035
We can't all have a king's bravery.

612
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,028
Hunger turns men into beasts.

613
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:22,998
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

614
00:47:23,028 --> 00:47:26,486
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

615
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:28,264
Wheat, barley, apples.

616
00:47:28,294 --> 00:47:29,967
We've had a blessed harvest.

617
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:33,971
And, of course, it's our duty
to assist the capital in time of need.

618
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:35,811
Well...

619
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:39,891
As Ser Loras said,
Lady Margaery has done this sort of...

620
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,122
charitable work before.

621
00:47:42,878 --> 00:47:44,683
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

622
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:47,806
I'm sure she does.

623
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:21,450
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night with no food or water.

624
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:30,979
They will stand until they drop.

625
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,240
Such is their obedience.

626
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:38,642
They may suit my needs.

627
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:40,590
Tell me of their training.

628
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,153
They begin their training at five.

629
00:49:03,183 --> 00:49:05,286
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk

630
00:49:05,316 --> 00:49:07,532
until they have mastered the shortsword,

631
00:49:07,562 --> 00:49:09,938
the shield, and the three spears.

632
00:49:09,968 --> 00:49:13,622
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

633
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,608
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.

634
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:21,145
They fear nothing.

635
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,652
Even the bravest men fear death.

636
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:48,510
My master says the Unsullied are not men.

637
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,939
Death means nothing to them.

638
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:02,290
He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.

639
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,462
Tell the good master there is no need.

640
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:30,907
My master points out that men don't need nipples.

641
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,808
To win his shield,

642
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,837
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

643
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,378
find a newborn...

644
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:56,558
and kill it before its mother's eyes.

645
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,730
This way, my master says,

646
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,410
we make certain
there is no weakness left in them.

647
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,642
You take a babe from its mother's arms,

648
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:12,264
kill it as she watches,
and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

649
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:29,669
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner,

650
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:30,939
not the mother.

651
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:39,175
How many do you have to sell?

652
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,705
8,000.

653
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:53,661
Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.

654
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:56,147
Many other buyers are interested.

655
00:52:06,725 --> 00:52:09,303
8,000 dead babies.

656
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:12,843
The Unsullied are a means to an end.

657
00:52:12,873 --> 00:52:14,780
Once I own them, these men...

658
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,113
They're not men.

659
00:52:16,143 --> 00:52:17,284
Not anymore.

660
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:20,677
Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?

661
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,217
Do you think these slaves

662
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:26,211
will have better lives
serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?

663
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:41,782
You'll be fair to them.

664
00:52:41,812 --> 00:52:44,562
You won't mutilate them to make a point.

665
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:51,441
You won't order them to murder babies.

666
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:54,316
You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.

667
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:56,864
A great injustice has been done to them.

668
00:52:58,271 --> 00:53:02,071
Closing your eyes will not undo it.

669
00:53:57,476 --> 00:53:58,706
The warlocks.

670
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:04,924
I owe you my life, ser.

671
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:07,220
The honor is mine,

672
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,206
my queen.

673
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:14,534
You know this man?

674
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:16,489
I know him

675
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,460
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

676
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:25,695
and as the Lord Commander
of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.

677
00:54:27,495 --> 00:54:29,102
King Robert is dead.

678
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:32,214
I have been searching for you,
Daenerys Stormborn,

679
00:54:32,613 --> 00:54:34,139
to ask your forgiveness.

680
00:54:35,162 --> 00:54:37,912
I was sworn to protect your family.

681
00:54:39,657 --> 00:54:40,818
I failed them.

682
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,750
I am Barristan Selmy,

683
00:54:49,567 --> 00:54:51,268
Kingsguard to your father.

684
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,633
Allow me to join your Queensguard

685
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:57,066
and I will not fail you again.

686
