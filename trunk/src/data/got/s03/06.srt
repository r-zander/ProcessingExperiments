<i>The raven brings the sight.</i>

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,755
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

3
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:05,867
Things that happened long before you were born or

4
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:08,620
things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,194
You have the sight, too?

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,388
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

7
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:15,766
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

8
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:18,268
- You'd like to know that.
- He's no crow.

9
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:22,258
We'll find out soon enough.

10
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,422
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

11
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:27,959
You told me your magic requires a king's blood.

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,655
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

13
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:32,026
But there are others with
your blood in their veins.

14
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:36,328
The Tyrells are plotting to
marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

15
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:38,752
We need to find Sansa Stark a different husband.

16
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:41,139
- You can't mean it.
- Tyrion will do as he's bid,

17
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,020
- as will you.
- What do you mean?

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,554
You'll marry Ser Loras.

19
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:46,380
- I will not.
- Yes, you will.

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,174
Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.

21
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,345
Pick him up, Locke.

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,556
Cut her free.

23
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,888
Find suitable rooms for our guests.
We'll speak later.

24
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:57,682
<i>- How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
- Not far, my lord.</i>

25
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,691
<i>Your sister's waiting for you there.</i>

26
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:04,380
Put him back where he belongs.

27
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,076
Rickard Karstark, I sentence you to die.

28
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:12,196
I need men to replace the
Karstarks who marched home.

29
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:15,041
There is only one person in this kingdom
with that kind of army.

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,578
The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry...

31
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,496
I shall have your head for this!

32
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,245
We have to go. Now!

33
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:32,283
<i>Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!</i>

34
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:36,542
<i>- Lord, cast your light...
- I thought he killed you.</i>

35
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,622
He did.

36
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:39,850
- But how...?
- How many times have you brought me back?

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,716
It's the Lord of Light brings you back.

38
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:44,257
- How many times?
- This makes six.

43
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,582
You've got too much wood in there.

44
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:55,128
But the more wood, the bigger the fire.

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,408
It needs to breathe.

46
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,134
Take off that big log.

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,259
You know your fires.

48
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,957
Someone built your fires for you growing up?

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,655
It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.

50
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:29,849
And there were servants, of course.

51
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,987
I knew you were highborn.

52
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:40,394
I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

53
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,428
Buried treasure.

54
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,867
Thousands of years old.

55
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:48,845
I think.

56
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,850
What does it do?

57
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:55,689
I'm not sure that it does anything.

58
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,902
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

59
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,861
How much longer?

60
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,300
Not so far.

61
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,794
A few more days.

62
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:14,786
Is the Wall as big as they say?

63
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,481
Bigger.

64
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,547
So big you can't even see the top sometimes.

65
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,420
It's hidden in clouds.

66
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:26,558
You're playing with me.

67
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:27,837
I'm not.

68
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,564
It's 700 feet high,

69
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,336
all made of ice.

70
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,555
On a warm day you can see it weeping.

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,636
Castle Black is nice enough.

72
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,837
They keep a fire burning in the long hall

73
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,659
day and night.

74
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:52,735
And Hobb makes venison stew

75
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,272
with onions.

76
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,173
Very tasty.

77
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,259
Sometimes...

78
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:00,740
one of the brothers will sing.

79
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,081
Dareon sings best.

80
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,042
- Do you sing?
- No.

81
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,879
No, no, no. Not very well.

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,907
Sing me a song.

83
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:15,973
All right.

84
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,598
Let's see.

85
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,016
<i>* The father's face is stern and strong *</i>

86
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,194
<i>* He sits and judges right from wrong *</i>

87
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:35,780
<i>* He weighs our lives, the short and long *</i>

88
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:39,057
<i>* And loves the little children *</i>

89
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,374
<i>* The mother gives the gift of life *</i>

90
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,232
<i>* And watches over every wife *</i>

91
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,173
<i>* Her gentle smile ends all strife *</i>

92
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,668
<i>* And she loves her little children. *</i>

93
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,999
That's not how you skin a rabbit.

94
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,612
I know how to skin a rabbit.

95
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:06,229
Not by the looks of it.

96
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,504
You grow up north of the Wall,

97
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,993
you learn the proper way to handle game.

98
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,654
I didn't see any game before I got here.

99
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,881
If I had a bow,
I could have shot a dozen rabbits.

100
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,555
Well, I made this bow myself.

101
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:36,719
Guess you don't learn how to
do that north of the Wall.

102
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,743
You learn how to use your fists, though.

103
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:40,773
Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?

104
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,062
I had someone else in mind.

105
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,632
Well, someone else is sitting right here.

106
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:46,293
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

107
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:47,736
Some of us...

108
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,417
is just a little better.

109
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:53,208
Well, some of us would say thank you when
someone else hunts down their breakfast for them.

110
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:55,503
Or don't they teach you to say
thank you north of the Wall?

111
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,698
You've got a big mouth, girl...

112
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,138
and too many teeth.

113
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:00,169
Stop it!

114
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,853
You've been fighting since you met.

115
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,944
Just stop it.

116
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:06,494
Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass,

117
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:10,290
it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.
- You've been nasty to her every day.

118
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,306
Of course she's nasty back.
- Me?

119
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:15,460
It's my fault? First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

120
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,817
First time I met you, you held a knife at me.

121
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:23,907
We can't fight each other.
We'll never make it to the Wall.

122
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,041
I want you both to make peace.

123
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:38,319
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

124
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,458
I said so, didn't I?

125
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,955
You're a good little hunter.

126
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,076
Thank you.

127
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,540
See?

128
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,081
Not so hard, is it? Thank you.

129
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,470
Don't push me.

130
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm right here with you.

131
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:08,824
What's happening?

132
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:10,647
I'm right here with you.

133
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,783
What's wrong with him?

134
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,804
The visions take their toll.

135
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,042
He's having one now?

136
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:44,829
I saw Jon Snow.

137
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,624
You saw him?

138
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,820
At Castle Black?

139
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,392
He was on the wrong side of the Wall...

140
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,245
surrounded by enemies.

141
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:10,013
Used to be you couldn't find a
tree within a mile of the Wall.

142
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,643
Crows would come out every morning with axes.

143
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,758
Your flock gets smaller every year.

144
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:27,663
You ever climbed it before?

145
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:28,918
No.

146
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,419
But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.

147
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,936
You're afraid.

148
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,296
<i>- Aren't you?
- Aye.</i>

149
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:47,235
It's a long way up and a long way down.

150
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:51,673
But I've waited my whole life
to see the world from up there.

151
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:59,181
Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.

152
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,644
They're too big for you, but they're good.

153
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:05,805
You kill someone for them?

154
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,358
I didn't kill him,

155
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,197
but I bet his balls are still bruised.

156
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,404
He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.

157
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:26,042
He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.

158
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,966
Can we not talk about that here?

159
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:31,348
"Can we not talk about that here?

160
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,183
I'm Jon Snow.

161
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:37,355
I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand,
but I'm scared of naked girls. "

162
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,562
- Did I seem scared the other day?
- You were trembling like a leaf.

163
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,126
Only in the beginning.

164
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,530
Only in the beginning.

165
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:50,380
You're a proper lover, Jon Snow.

166
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:52,851
And don't worry.

167
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:56,033
Your secret's safe with me.

168
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,143
What secret?

169
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:03,745
Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls
in silk dresses you knew growing up?

170
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,285
You're loyal and you're brave.

171
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:17,213
You didn't stop being a crow
the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.

172
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,242
But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.

173
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:31,463
You're going to be loyal to your woman.

174
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,578
The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.

175
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:42,821
Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.

176
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:44,754
We're just soldiers in their armies

177
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:48,024
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

178
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,284
It's you and me

179
00:12:57,206 --> 00:13:00,073
that matters to me and you.

180
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,596
Don't ever betray me.

181
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,854
I won't.

182
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:19,885
'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off
and wear it 'round my neck.

183
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:33,871
Sink your metal deep

184
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:37,441
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

185
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,977
And if you fall,

186
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,746
don't scream.

187
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,344
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

188
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:10,358
You're good.

189
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,084
You're not as good as you think you are.

190
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:22,421
Face, tits, balls...

191
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,411
<i>I hit 'em right where I wanted to.</i>

192
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,793
Aye, but you took your sweet time of it.

193
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,330
You won't be fighting straw men, little lady.

194
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,600
Show me your position.

195
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,171
Keep your elbow high.

196
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:43,174
You want your back doing the hard labor.

197
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,810
You're holding.

198
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,594
Never hold.

199
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:51,848
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

200
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,206
Pull the string back to the center of your chin

201
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:55,651
and release.

202
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,250
Never hold.

203
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:59,165
But I have to aim.

204
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,267
Never aim.

205
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:02,958
Never aim?

206
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:06,729
Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go.

207
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:09,072
Trust your eye.

208
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:15,170
There's someone out there.

209
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,958
That's about far enough.

210
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:42,410
We come as friends.

211
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,706
Begging your pardon, m'lady,
but we'll be the judge of that.

212
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:50,303
Valar morghulis.

213
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:51,925
Valar dohaeris.

214
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,178
My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.

215
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,191
Why are you here, my lady?

216
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:49,663
Forgive my manners.

217
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:52,820
I don't see many ladies these days.

218
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,278
Lucky for the ladies.

219
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:26,383
How many times has the Lord brought him back?

220
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,413
Six.

221
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,930
I've always been a terrible priest.

222
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,960
Drank too much rum.

223
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:02,556
Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.

224
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,703
It's a terrible thing to say,

225
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:10,056
but by the time I came to Westeros,
I didn't believe in our Lord.

226
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,322
I decided that He,

227
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,490
that all the gods were stories

228
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,760
we told the
children to make them behave.

229
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:23,279
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

230
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,910
but it was just for show.

231
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,833
A spectacle for the locals.

232
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:34,617
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

233
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,733
I knelt beside his cold body

234
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:43,498
and said the old words.

235
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,028
Not because I believed in them, but...

236
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,997
he was my friend

237
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,046
and he was dead.

238
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,118
And they were the only words I knew.

239
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:01,506
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

240
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,717
Beric's eyes opened

241
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,811
and I knew the truth.

242
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,517
Our god is the one true god.

243
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:16,465
And all men must serve Him.

244
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,903
You've been to the other side.

245
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,342
The other side?

246
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,770
There is no other side.

247
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:36,653
I have been to the darkness, my lady.

248
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,829
He sent you to us for a reason.

249
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,056
You have someone He needs.

250
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,633
Bodkin point.

251
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:54,150
Penetrates plate at 200 yards.

252
00:19:58,202 --> 00:19:59,833
Can you make 'em?

253
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,658
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.

254
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:05,012
Just need decent steel.

255
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,083
I'll get you the steel.

256
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,265
I don't like that woman.

257
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:16,623
That's 'cause you're a girl.

258
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,676
What does that have to do with anything?

259
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:26,431
Forgive me, lad.

260
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,809
What are you doing?

261
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,260
Let go of him.

262
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:35,123
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

263
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,838
He wants to be one of you.

264
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,162
He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!

265
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,214
We serve the Lord of Light

266
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,760
and the Lord of Light needs this boy.

267
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:46,827
Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?

268
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:54,780
You're not doing this for your god.

269
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:56,829
You're doing it for gold.

270
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,229
We're doing it for both, girl.

271
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:03,438
We can't defend the people without weapons
and horses and food.

272
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:08,342
And we can't get weapons and
horses and food without gold.

273
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:11,003
You told me this was a Brotherhood.

274
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:14,290
You told me I could be one of you.

275
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,775
You are more than they can ever be.

276
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:25,387
They're just foot soldiers in the great war.

277
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,657
You will make kings rise and fall.

278
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,112
You're a witch.

279
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,828
You're going to hurt him.

280
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:50,215
I see a darkness in you.

281
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,804
And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me...

282
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,680
brown eyes,

283
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,131
blue eyes,

284
00:21:58,268 --> 00:21:59,567
green eyes.

285
00:22:00,964 --> 00:22:03,160
Eyes you'll shut forever.

286
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,475
We will meet again.

287
00:23:24,187 --> 00:23:26,548
You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?

288
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:38,646
You all right?

289
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,801
Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.

290
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:59,048
Sorry.

291
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,835
Were you sleeping?

292
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,023
Wa...

293
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:06,285
Wa...?

294
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:07,787
Wa...?

295
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:10,708
Water?

296
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:13,179
You want some water.

297
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,195
I wish I had some for you.

298
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:34,192
So let's play a game.

299
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,752
Which body part do you need the least?

300
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:44,268
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

301
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,703
I'll tell you everything, please.

302
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:48,473
But...

303
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:51,151
you've already told me everything.

304
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:52,726
Remember?

305
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,454
Your daddy was mean to you.

306
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,931
The Starks didn't appreciate you.

307
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,636
One good bit, though.

308
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:04,946
The Stark boys,

309
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,097
they're still alive.

310
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,105
Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?

311
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:14,770
You failed, but...

312
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,436
I'm a better hunter than you.

313
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,485
Now...

314
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:23,443
how about your little finger?

315
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,262
You don't use that for much, do you?

316
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:26,343
No? Good.

317
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,949
Let's start with that.

318
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:41,567
You've been wondering why you're here.
Haven't you?

319
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,056
Where you are.

320
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:48,925
Who I am.
Why I'm doing this to you.

321
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:53,068
So guess.

322
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:55,846
If you guess right,

323
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:56,966
I'll tell you.

324
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:00,075
By the old gods and the new, I swear it.

325
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:03,815
You win the game

326
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:07,616
if you can figure out who I am
and why I'm torturing you

327
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:10,964
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

328
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,651
If I win,

329
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:16,518
you'll let me go?

330
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:21,666
If you think this has a happy ending,

331
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,876
you haven't been paying attention.

332
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:25,564
Please.

333
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,902
You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't.

334
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:34,696
You first.

335
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,166
Where are we?

336
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,001
The North.

337
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,620
Too vague.

338
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,085
Deepwood Motte.

339
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,268
Terrible guess.

340
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,351
Now...

341
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:57,632
where?

342
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:00,163
Last Hearth.

343
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:03,233
Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?

344
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,311
Karhold!

345
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:17,022
Karhold?

346
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,171
How did you know that?

347
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:27,176
Did you see any banners flying when we came in?

348
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:28,298
No.

349
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:30,813
It was just a guess.

350
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,159
Very good, Lord Theon.

351
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,771
And who am I?

352
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:41,450
Torrhen Karstark.

353
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:42,877
He's dead.

354
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,189
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

355
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:50,021
He was your brother.

356
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:58,617
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

357
00:28:08,256 --> 00:28:11,155
- You swore to tell me if I...
- You're right.

358
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:16,028
Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman.

359
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,750
I betrayed Robb.

360
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,136
That's why you're torturing me.

361
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:26,049
Yes.

362
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:31,271
You win.

363
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:45,388
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.

364
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,709
You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

365
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,662
I'm afraid I am.

366
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,603
Everything I told you is a lie.

367
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,280
This isn't happening to you for a reason.

368
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,190
Well, one reason...

369
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,374
I enjoy it.

370
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:15,012
Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

371
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:22,967
I win.

372
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:26,260
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

373
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,425
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

374
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:31,197
The roads are crawling with
cutthroats and bandits.

375
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,249
But when the King of the
North summons us, we come.

376
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:37,009
Our father has instructed us to tell you

377
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,894
that his alliance with the North can continue

378
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,582
if his terms are met.

379
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,451
Lord Frey requires a formal apology

380
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:49,146
for your violation of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.

381
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:51,780
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

382
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,035
As restitution for this betrayal,

383
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:57,556
he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.

384
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:00,821
- I don't think that's...
- We are fighting for the North.

385
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,993
Harrenhal is not in the North.

386
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,628
It is his

387
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:07,673
once the war is over

388
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:09,791
and we have no further strategic need for it.

389
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:13,007
And there's something else.

390
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:16,868
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

391
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,298
Not what.

392
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,313
Whom.

393
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,754
What?

394
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
No.

395
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,521
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed
one of his daughters...

396
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,313
How old is she?

397
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:38,393
19.

398
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:41,363
- Could I see her first?
- You want to count her teeth?

399
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:44,210
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

400
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,982
We need an answer before we leave

401
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:49,540
and a wedding not more than a fortnight
thereafter or this alliance is at an end.

402
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,002
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

403
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:54,582
Father is old.

404
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:59,723
It will put his heart at peace
if he could see her wed to a good husband.

405
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:04,853
And his recent experience has made him wary
of long engagements.

406
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,711
He has every right to be.

407
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,469
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

408
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:30,287
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

409
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:33,205
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

410
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:34,855
I'm his liege lord.

411
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:37,150
He's a proud man and we've wounded him.

412
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,630
I didn't wound him.

413
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,698
My answer is no.

414
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:45,893
Listen to me

415
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:49,427
and listen very carefully. You...

416
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:52,554
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

417
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,976
No man can compel another man to marry.

418
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:57,326
The laws of my fist are
about to compel your teeth.

419
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:59,356
It's all right. You heard him.

420
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,889
If you refuse, our alliance
with the Freys is dead.

421
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:07,518
He's wanted me for one of his
daughters since I was 12.

422
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:08,948
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

423
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,580
When I say no, he will come back

424
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:14,571
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

425
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:18,904
You're willing to risk our freedom
and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

426
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,838
I have a war to fight.

427
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:23,313
We can't win it without them.

428
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,177
I have no time to haggle.

429
00:32:25,452 --> 00:32:28,318
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

430
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:31,138
You recall that heroic engagement?

431
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:38,087
I had something less permanent in mind.

432
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,557
I've won every battle,

433
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,825
but I'm losing this war.

434
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:46,267
If we don't do this and do it now,

435
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:48,921
we're lost.

436
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:56,426
I'll marry her.

437
00:32:57,503 --> 00:32:59,880
You're paying for my sins, Uncle.

438
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:02,216
It's not fair or right.

439
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,211
I'll remember it.

440
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:14,616
I see my men have finally found you
something appropriate to wear.

441
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:17,193
Yes. Most kind of them.

442
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:20,532
You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

443
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:25,378
I am acting on Lady Stark's orders
to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.

444
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:29,053
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

445
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:32,714
If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her for treason.

446
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:41,962
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

447
00:33:41,992 --> 00:33:43,698
You should.

448
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,687
But instead, you're sitting here

449
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:49,127
watching me fail at dinner.

450
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,324
Why might that be?

451
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:53,167
Wars cost money.

452
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,805
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

453
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:58,553
We both know who would pay the most.

454
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:01,538
Or make you pay the most

455
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:05,559
if he found out you had captured me and
sent me back up north for a summary execution.

456
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,794
You're right.

457
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:12,149
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

458
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,392
It would be,

459
00:34:13,656 --> 00:34:16,824
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

460
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,572
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.

461
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:21,792
He doesn't have time for anything else.

462
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:23,760
He'll make time for you.

463
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:31,854
As soon as you're well enough to travel,
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

464
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:35,193
as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.

465
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,760
And you will swear to tell your father the truth,

466
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,073
that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

467
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,815
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

468
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:56,307
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

469
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,250
Very well.

470
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:01,447
My lady,

471
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:05,132
may our journey continue
without further incident.

472
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:07,070
Oh, she won't be going with you.

473
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:09,507
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to...

474
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:12,235
You are charged with abetting treason.

475
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:14,327
I'm afraid I must insist.

476
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,364
You're in no place to insist on anything.

477
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:21,244
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson
about overplaying your...

478
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,072
position.

479
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:28,980
- Impossible.
- Why?

480
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,828
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

481
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:35,193
The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.

482
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,820
- Your daughter...
- Is rich,

483
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,170
the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms...

484
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:45,670
and the mother of the king.
- Old.

485
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:47,761
Old?

486
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:50,197
Old.

487
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:53,323
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

488
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:55,835
Her change will be upon her before long.

489
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:59,490
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

490
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,073
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

491
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:04,492
but this is another matter entirely.

492
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,938
The years punish us as well, I promise you that.

493
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,281
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

494
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:16,881
The only thing that might turn it are

495
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:20,176
details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

496
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,703
- Do you deny them?
- Oh, not at all.

497
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,835
A sword swallower through and through.

498
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:29,144
And a boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity

499
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:31,946
to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms

500
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:34,462
and remove the stain from his name.

501
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,340
Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

502
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,821
Sons of your father's bannermen,
squires, stable boys?

503
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,443
Of course.

504
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,103
And you...

505
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:46,622
never...

506
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:49,121
No.

507
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,659
Not once?
Not in any way?

508
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:54,338
Never.

509
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,587
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

510
00:36:57,617 --> 00:37:01,443
But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go
at each other beneath the sheets.

511
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:06,259
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance
for unnatural behavior.

512
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,862
I wouldn't say that.

513
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:12,521
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots
over a discreet bit of buggery, but...

514
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,691
brothers and sisters...

515
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:22,938
where I come from, that stain
would be very difficult to wash out.

516
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:28,258
I will not breathe further life
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

517
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:31,569
Lie or not,

518
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,882
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

519
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:39,347
Convincing enough to put swords in their hands
and send them off to kill Lannisters

520
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,578
and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.

521
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,055
I don't care what people believe.

522
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:47,436
And neither do you.

523
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:51,576
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

524
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:55,212
Now, if the rumors about my children were true,

525
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:58,343
then Joffrey is no king at all

526
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:02,420
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

527
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:06,254
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,

528
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,061
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

529
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:13,457
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

530
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:16,653
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.

531
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:19,192
All right.

532
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:21,974
I'll remove it for you.

533
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:25,644
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,

534
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:28,547
I will name him to the Kingsguard.

535
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:32,016
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.

536
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:34,951
He will never marry.
He will never have children.

537
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,602
The Tyrell name will fade.

538
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:41,619
And Highgarden will go to the children
of Joffrey and Margaery.

539
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:45,900
You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?

540
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:49,584
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

541
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:52,722
who takes his vows seriously.

542
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,765
So, shall I draw up the order?

543
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:59,735
Or do you consent to this marriage?

544
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,837
It's a rare enough thing...

545
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:10,767
a man who lives up to his reputation.

546
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,257
No!

547
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,395
We've gotta cut them loose!

548
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,600
No!

549
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:15,688
Take my hand!

550
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:53,179
That's a wonderful pin.

551
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,597
It's more of a brooch, really.

552
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:03,814
Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so...

553
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:11,382
I'm very happy about...

554
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:14,200
Uh, yes.

555
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,799
I am as well.

556
00:42:18,988 --> 00:42:23,001
- I feel like I'm in a dream.
- Yes, me, too. Definitely.

557
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,659
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

558
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:30,779
The guests,
the food, the tournaments.

559
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,254
And the bride, of course.

560
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:43,457
The most beautiful bride in the world

561
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:47,891
in a beautiful gown of gold
and green brocade with fringed sleeves.

562
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,902
Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

563
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:57,300
No. I had never left Winterfell
before I came to King's Landing.

564
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:01,747
But it sounds wonderful.
I can't wait to see it.

565
00:43:02,861 --> 00:43:05,227
And to leave this place.

566
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:07,917
It's terrible, isn't it?

567
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,711
The most terrible place there is.

568
00:43:22,273 --> 00:43:25,472
<i>I don't suppose there's
anything we can do about this.</i>

569
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:27,838
We can have them both killed.

570
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:33,564
It's hard to say which of the four of us
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

571
00:43:34,408 --> 00:43:35,933
Probably Sansa.

572
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:40,638
Though Loras will certainly come to know
a deep and singular misery.

573
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,431
Father doesn't discriminate.

574
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,144
We're all being shipped off to hell together.

575
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,979
On a boat you built.

576
00:43:49,758 --> 00:43:52,304
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family. I did

577
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:54,549
what I did to protect our family.

578
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,123
I'm your family.

579
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,517
A member of your family

580
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:03,188
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

581
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:07,543
Whether or not you or Father
or anyone else wants to admit it.

582
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:09,102
I do admit it.

583
00:44:10,154 --> 00:44:12,741
If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,

584
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:16,489
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

585
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:19,233
Our heads would still be rotting
on the city gate.

586
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:23,111
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

587
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:29,851
There are two people in King's Landing
who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

588
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:33,171
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon

589
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:36,118
to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

590
00:44:45,493 --> 00:44:47,674
The impulse I understand.

591
00:44:49,214 --> 00:44:51,978
He hates me because I'm the only one

592
00:44:52,008 --> 00:44:54,728
who tells him what he really is.

593
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:01,657
So, fair enough. He wants me dead.

594
00:45:02,547 --> 00:45:04,616
But his stupidity?

595
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:07,887
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

596
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,906
But the king...

597
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,961
orders a Kingsguard
to murder the Hand of the King

598
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:17,523
in full view of his own army.
The boy's an idiot.

599
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:18,893
What do you want me to say?

600
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:21,769
I want you to tell me if my
life is still in danger.

601
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:22,809
Probably.

602
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:28,036
But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now Father's here.

603
00:45:29,085 --> 00:45:33,509
Seven kingdoms united in fear
of Tywin Lannister.

604
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,570
Not the Tyrells.

605
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:38,578
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

606
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:42,111
Joffrey will belong to Margaery,
the little doe-eyed whore.

607
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:45,026
And so will his children and their children.

608
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:47,470
History will be taken from our hands.

609
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:50,952
You may escape, at least.

610
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:53,363
Once Jaime gets back,

611
00:45:53,393 --> 00:45:57,720
Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case
of sword through bowels.

612
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:01,133
When Jaime gets back, yes.

613
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,057
But when do we think that's going to be?
He's out there somewhere.

614
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:08,286
Jaime or not, I'm...

615
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,031
truly fucked.

616
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,912
Who's going to tell her?

617
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,318
Do you think people will like it?

618
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,854
I don't think they will even notice it.

619
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:24,113
You're right. It's not my wedding.

620
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:28,631
Anyway, from what I can tell,
the dressmakers in Highgarden

621
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,335
will be far superior
to the ones in King's Landing.

622
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:35,534
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

623
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,827
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

624
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:40,195
I'm sure he does.

625
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:44,215
Will they let me invite my family?

626
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:46,298
They haven't asked my opinion.

627
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:47,872
But do you think they will?

628
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:49,822
No.

629
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,743
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.
Should I...

630
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:01,534
I beg your pardon, my lady.

631
00:47:02,942 --> 00:47:07,312
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on
a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.

632
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,259
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

633
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:15,042
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

634
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:16,506
Of course.

635
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:19,376
Alone, if I may.

636
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:21,756
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

637
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,733
Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.
She's not from here.

638
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:29,070
But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.

639
00:47:31,855 --> 00:47:33,027
Sometimes...

640
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:35,755
we think we want to hear something

641
00:47:35,785 --> 00:47:38,926
and it's only afterwards when
it's too late that we...

642
00:47:39,347 --> 00:47:43,310
realize we wished we'd heard it
under entirely different circumstances.

643
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,160
It's all right, really.

644
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:50,233
How to begin?

645
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,082
It's...

646
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:57,121
this...

647
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:59,202
this is awkward.

648
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:03,138
1,000 blades

649
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:06,928
taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies,

650
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:10,264
forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.

651
00:48:10,294 --> 00:48:12,211
There aren't 1,000 blades.

652
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:15,298
There aren't even 200.

653
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,517
I've counted.

654
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:19,437
Ha, I'm sure you have.

655
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,331
Ugly old thing.

656
00:48:23,143 --> 00:48:25,295
Yet it has a certain appeal.

657
00:48:26,212 --> 00:48:28,318
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

658
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:31,283
Shame you had to settle for your second choice.

659
00:48:31,313 --> 00:48:33,423
Early days, my friend.

660
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:35,818
It is flattering, really...

661
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:40,363
you feeling such dread

662
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:42,870
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

663
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,009
Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition,
I promise you.

664
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:51,011
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

665
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,657
You're so right.

666
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:54,144
For instance,

667
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:58,254
when I thwarted your plan
to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

668
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:00,116
If I'm going to be honest,

669
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,728
I did feel an unmistakable sense of

670
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,363
enjoyment there.

671
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:07,799
But your confidant,

672
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:12,022
the one who fed you information about my plans,

673
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:14,118
the one you swore to protect...

674
00:49:15,927 --> 00:49:18,427
you didn't bring her any enjoyment.

675
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:21,748
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

676
00:49:23,423 --> 00:49:26,010
She was a bad investment on my part.

677
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:29,307
Luckily...

678
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:33,482
I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.

679
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:35,740
Something daring.

680
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:40,697
And he was so grateful to me for providing

681
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:44,116
this fresh experience.

682
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,684
I did what I did for the good of the realm.

683
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:52,741
The realm?

684
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:55,991
Do you know what the realm is?

685
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:01,108
It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies.

686
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:06,080
A story we agree to tell each other over and over

687
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,633
till we forget that it's a lie.

688
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:12,449
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?

689
00:50:13,414 --> 00:50:14,414
Chaos.

690
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,892
A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

691
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:19,204
Chaos...

692
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:20,604
isn't a pit.

693
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:23,463
Chaos is a ladder.

694
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,540
<i>Many who try to climb it fail</i>

695
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,860
<i>and never get to try again.</i>

696
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,084
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

697
00:50:43,272 --> 00:50:44,522
<i>And some...</i>

698
00:50:45,014 --> 00:50:47,048
<i>are given a chance to climb,</i>

699
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,415
<i>but they refuse.</i>

700
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,657
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

701
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,924
<i>or the gods</i>

702
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:55,891
<i>or love.</i>

703
00:50:57,469 --> 00:50:58,469
<i>Illusions.</i>

704
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:02,403
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

705
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,316
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>

706
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:47,015
