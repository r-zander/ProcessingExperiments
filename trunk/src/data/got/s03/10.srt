1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,032
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:07,020
Reject this gift and I shall show you no mercy.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,465
You are mad.

4
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,006
It was just as you said.

5
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:13,655
Their slave soldiers threw down
their spears and surrendered.

6
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:15,394
The bitch stays.

7
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:18,838
I'm taking her to King's Landing.
Unless you kill me.

8
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,889
Well, we must be on our way.

9
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:24,498
- Please.
- I'm not killing you.

10
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,938
<i>Just making a few alterations.</i>

11
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:28,444
No! Don't!

12
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:30,681
<i>The Nightfort's closest to Castle Black.</i>

13
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:32,728
It's got a secret sally port,

14
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:34,826
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

15
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:38,052
It leads through the Wall
right down into the Nightfort.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,394
Stop.

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,702
But your father...

18
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,252
I won't share your bed.

19
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:44,061
Not until you want me to.

20
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,867
What if I never want you to?

21
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,971
And so my watch begins.

22
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,037
He's a crow.

23
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,353
He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.

24
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:54,542
Kill him.

25
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,069
The wolves are out there.
You're a warg, Bran.

26
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,350
Do it.

27
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,579
I'm going beyond the Wall.

28
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,334
It won't be safe for Rickon.

29
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,565
I'm coming with you.

30
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:17,182
You and Osha and
Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.

31
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:19,713
- She's just going to kill him.
- Sacrifice him.

32
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:21,159
<i>The boy's your nephew.</i>

33
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,815
The usurper Robb Stark...

34
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:25,919
<i>She says there's power in king's blood.</i>

35
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:27,823
Got salt pork for the feast.

36
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,641
The feast is over.

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,364
Robb!

38
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,233
Mother.

39
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,798
The Lannisters send their regards.

40
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:40,900
It's too late.

Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

51
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,803
What are you doing?

52
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,874
I have a list.

53
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:28,711
A list of people you mean to kill?

54
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,113
For laughing at me?

55
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,725
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

56
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,325
No, death seems a bit extreme.

57
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,096
Fear of death, on the other hand...

58
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,857
You should learn to ignore them.

59
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:41,846
My lady, people have been laughing at me
far longer than they've been laughing at you.

60
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,922
I'm the Halfman,
the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

61
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:47,328
You're a Lannister.

62
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:51,335
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

63
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,928
The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.

64
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,763
We're perfect for each other.

65
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:01,503
So how should we punish them?

66
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,054
Who? Whom?

67
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,952
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

68
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,940
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

69
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:14,544
Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

70
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:17,318
I hear that you're a pervert.

71
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:20,622
I am the Imp.
I have certain standards to maintain.

72
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:26,177
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.

73
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,621
You cut a little hole in his mattress

74
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,417
and you stuff sheep dung inside.

75
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,176
Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.

76
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:36,209
His room will stink, but he won't
know where it's coming from.

77
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,473
Lady Sansa!

78
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:40,395
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

79
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,720
And she was always angry with me.

80
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:44,893
Why sheep shift?

81
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,813
That's the vulgar word for dung.

82
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,855
- My lady...
- Well, you asked me.

83
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,713
<i>That's him!</i>

84
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,751
My lord, my lady.

85
00:06:57,781 --> 00:07:00,754
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

86
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:10,301
Killed a few puppies today?

87
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:12,775
Show him.

88
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,538
Come on, show him.

89
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:23,823
Oh, apologies, my lord.
Old fingers.

90
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,690
"Roslin caught a fine fat trout.

91
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:39,257
Her brothers gave her a pair
of wolf pelts for her wedding.

92
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:41,252
Signed Walder Frey. "

93
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:47,244
Is that bad poetry
or is it supposed to mean something?

94
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,342
Robb Stark is dead.

95
00:07:50,697 --> 00:07:52,676
And his bitch mother.

96
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,899
Write back to Lord Frey.

97
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:58,598
Thank him for his service and command him

98
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,921
to send Robb Stark's head.

99
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm going to serve it to
Sansa at my wedding feast.

100
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,548
Your Grace,

101
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,937
Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.

102
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,407
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

103
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,669
Yes, I did.

104
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,015
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

105
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,159
No.

106
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,303
She is no longer yours to torment.

107
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:22,518
Everyone is mine to torment.

108
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,215
You'd do well to remember that,
you little monster.

109
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,908
Oh, I'm a monster.

110
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,615
Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.

111
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,936
Monsters are dangerous

112
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:38,728
and just now kings are dying like flies.

113
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,604
I could have your tongue out

114
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:50,582
for saying that.

115
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,942
Let him make his threats.

116
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,384
He's a bitter little man.

117
00:08:56,414 --> 00:08:59,073
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

118
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:02,172
Unacceptable, disrespectful,

119
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,308
and in very bad taste.

120
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,451
I am the king!

121
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:08,678
I will punish you.

122
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,432
Any man who must say, "I am the king"

123
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,232
is no true king.

124
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:18,257
I'll make sure you understand that
when I've won your war for you.

125
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:20,266
My father won the real war.

126
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:23,515
He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown

127
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:26,061
while you hid under Casterly Rock!

128
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,675
The king is tired.

129
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:42,959
See him to his chambers.

130
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,317
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

131
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:47,882
We have so much to celebrate.

132
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:51,212
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

133
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,991
Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade

134
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,608
to help him sleep.

135
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,989
I'm not...

136
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,136
tired!

137
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:04,896
Come.

138
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:26,790
Not you.

139
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:39,299
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros
to bed without his supper.

140
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:43,184
You're a fool if you believe he's
the most powerful man in Westeros.

141
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,926
A treasonous statement.

142
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,307
Joffrey is king.

143
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,110
You really think a crown gives you power?

144
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,095
No.

145
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,697
I think armies give you power.

146
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,342
Robb Stark had one,

147
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:00,529
never lost a battle,

148
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,707
and you defeated him all the same.

149
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,433
Oh, I know.

150
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:09,244
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

151
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:12,666
Or the blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.

152
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:17,260
Walder Frey is many things,
but a brave man?

153
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,207
No.

154
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:25,383
He never would have risked such an action
if he didn't have certain assurances.

155
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:26,783
Which he got from me.

156
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:29,880
Do you disapprove?

157
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,346
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

158
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:34,351
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

159
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:39,338
Explain to me why it is more noble
to kill 10,000 men in battle

160
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,998
than a dozen at dinner.

161
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,137
So that's why you did it?

162
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,703
- To save lives?
- To end the war.

163
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:48,001
To protect the family.

164
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:51,009
Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?

165
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,536
Go ahead, write one.

166
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:56,121
I'm in this world a little while longer

167
00:11:56,893 --> 00:12:00,457
to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

168
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,944
The northerners will never forget.

169
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:03,976
Good.

170
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:08,436
Let them remember what happens
when they march on the south.

171
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,184
All the Stark men are dead.

172
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,481
Winterfell is a ruin.

173
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,957
Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North

174
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,858
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

175
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,608
I believe you still have some
work to do on that score.

176
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:36,375
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

177
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:40,066
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

178
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:43,154
One way or another, you will
get that girl pregnant.

179
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:45,032
I will not rape her.

180
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,058
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

181
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,849
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

182
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:56,715
The house that puts family
first will always defeat the house

183
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:00,477
that puts the whims and wishes
of its sons and daughters first.

184
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:06,787
A good man does everything in his power
to better his family's position

185
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,788
regardless of his own selfish desires.

186
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:18,291
- Does that amuse you?
- No, it's a very good lesson.

187
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:22,519
Only it's easy for you to
preach utter devotion to family

188
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,963
when you're making all the decisions.

189
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,309
Easy for me, is it?

190
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:30,564
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

191
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,616
but solely for the benefit of the family?

192
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,934
The day that you were born.

193
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:44,105
I wanted to carry you into the sea
and let the waves wash you away.

194
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:48,478
Instead, I let you live.

195
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:52,378
And I brought you up as my son.

196
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,505
Because you're a Lannister.

197
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:15,634
Sansa.

198
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,443
It's empty.

199
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,274
Let's find a place to sleep.

200
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,239
Don't, Hodor.

201
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,266
Maybe we shouldn't stay.

202
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,246
You'd rather be out there?

203
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:17,182
There are a lot of stories about this place.

204
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,275
Horrible stories.

205
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:22,487
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

206
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:23,832
So did I.

207
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,406
Once.

208
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,636
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

209
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,682
No.

210
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:32,942
Who's he?

211
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:35,452
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

212
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,597
He was angry at the king for something,
I don't remember.

213
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:43,452
When the king was visiting the Nightfort,

214
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:45,903
the cook killed the king's son,

215
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,010
cooked him into a big pie

216
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,596
with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.

217
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:52,792
That night...

218
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:54,795
he served the pie to the king.

219
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:58,104
He liked the taste of his son so much,

220
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:00,384
he asked for a second slice.

221
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,989
The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat

222
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,530
who could only eat his own young.

223
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,908
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since,

224
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,897
devouring his own babies.

225
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,906
But no matter what he does,

226
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:19,821
he's always hungry.

227
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:24,020
If the gods turned every killer
into a giant white rat...

228
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,988
It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook

229
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:29,528
or for serving the king's son in a pie.

230
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:32,009
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

231
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:36,415
That's something the gods can't forgive.

232
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:46,178
"The late Walder Frey",

233
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,919
old Tully called me because I didn't

234
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:51,255
get my men to the Trident in time for battle.

235
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:52,962
He thought he was witty.

236
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,580
Look at us now, Tully.

237
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:57,269
You're dead,

238
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:00,138
your daughter's dead,
your grandson's dead,

239
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:04,582
your son spent his wedding night
in a dungeon and...

240
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:06,962
I'm Lord of Riverrun.

241
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,887
The Blackfish escaped.

242
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:14,163
An old man on the run

243
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:15,515
with no allies.

244
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:19,466
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
Who does he have?

245
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,334
As you say.

246
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,231
They all laughed at me,

247
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:27,620
all those high lords.
They all thought they were better than me.

248
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:29,495
Ned Stark,

249
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,989
Hoster Tully.

250
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:32,843
People snigger,

251
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,139
when I marry a young girl,

252
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,859
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

253
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,818
You'll be needing a new young girl.

254
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,229
Got that to look forward to.

255
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,158
And you,

256
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,028
the Warden of the North.

257
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,181
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

258
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:57,306
Must have been torture
following that stupid boy all over the country.

259
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,467
He ignored my advice at every turn.

260
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:02,277
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

261
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,399
Calling himself the Young Wolf.

262
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:07,307
How's that for pomposity?

263
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,134
Well...

264
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:11,407
here's to the Young Wolf!

265
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,319
Forever young.

266
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,955
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

267
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,464
At some point perhaps.

268
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:27,244
But Winterfell's in ruins.

269
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,290
Yeah.

270
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,174
What happened up there?

271
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:35,052
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

272
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,938
I heard he killed all the ravens.
And after that...

273
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,567
nothing.

274
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:44,111
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

275
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,263
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn
if they gave us Theon.

276
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,568
- And?
- Ramsay delivered the terms.

277
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,886
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

278
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:58,935
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

279
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:00,855
But Ramsay...

280
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:02,349
Well...

281
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:06,326
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

282
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:08,986
Well, the girls weren't lying.

283
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,003
You had a good-sized cock.

284
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,637
What?

285
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:22,582
No.

286
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,886
Pork sausage.

287
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:29,988
You think I'm some sort of savage?

288
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,911
People talk about...

289
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,330
phantom limbs.

290
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:47,827
An amputee might have an itch
where his foot used to be.

291
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,532
So I've always wondered...

292
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,918
do eunuchs...

293
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:57,100
have a phantom cock?

294
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,382
Next time you think about naked girls,

295
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,534
would you feel an itch?

296
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:12,981
Sorry.

297
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,224
I shouldn't make jokes.

298
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:21,582
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

299
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,726
But my father taught me...

300
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,265
to aim for their head.

301
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:29,834
Kill me.

302
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,657
Sorry, what?

303
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,025
Kill me.

304
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:38,881
A little louder.

305
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:40,598
Kill me!

306
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,537
You're no good to me dead.

307
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,293
We need you.

308
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:11,418
You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

309
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,981
That's a name for a lord.

310
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:17,880
But you're not a lord,

311
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,577
are you?

312
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,199
You're just meat.

313
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:28,333
Stinking meat.

314
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:33,278
You reek.

315
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,094
Reek!

316
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:39,473
That's a good name for you.

317
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,884
What's your name?

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,664
Theon Greyjoy.

319
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,446
What's your name?

320
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:55,722
Th...

321
00:21:56,852 --> 00:21:58,627
Theon Greyjoy.

322
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:07,463
Please.

323
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,593
What is your name?!

324
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,295
Reek.

325
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:20,363
My name is...

326
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,198
Reek.

327
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:51,142
Hodor.

328
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,457
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

329
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,829
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

330
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,842
Gilly. Don't hurt us.

331
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,961
Where are you going?

332
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,204
To Castle Black. I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

333
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:39,724
My brother, he's in the Night's...

334
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,775
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

335
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,284
You're Jon's brother.

336
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:56,029
- The one who fell from the window.
- No, I'm not.

337
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:01,236
I've been around Ghost enough to
know a direwolf when I see one.

338
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,874
And I've heard all about Hodor.

339
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:10,209
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

340
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:12,882
If you're his brother, you're my brother, too.

341
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:15,282
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

342
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,746
Take us north of the Wall.

343
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:23,994
What?

344
00:24:24,328 --> 00:24:27,903
- Why in the world would you want to go...
- I don't want to. I have to.

345
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,814
How did you get through the Wall?

346
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,594
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

347
00:24:33,954 --> 00:24:35,107
Come with us.

348
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:39,250
There are steps carved into
the south side of the Wall.

349
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,031
Hodor can carry you to the top.

350
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,233
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

351
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:46,355
Come with us. There's nothing north but death.

352
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:49,002
If Jon is alive,

353
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:52,536
then Castle Black's where he'll be.
It's the safest place for you.

354
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:55,440
There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.

355
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:57,730
What I know is what I saw.

356
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,950
And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.

357
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,017
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

358
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:06,952
How do you know all that?

359
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:09,357
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

360
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:13,275
The kings of Westeros and all
their armies can't stop them.

361
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,334
But you're going to stop them?

362
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,064
Please, Sam.

363
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,842
I have to go north.

364
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,085
I have to.

365
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:05,258
"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands
and invader of the North.

366
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:11,286
I give you until the full moon
to order all ironborn scum out of the North

367
00:26:11,942 --> 00:26:16,299
and back to those shit-stained rocks
you call a home.

368
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:19,452
On the first night of the full moon,

369
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,839
I will hunt down every islander
still in our lands...

370
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:26,172
and flay them living

371
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:30,129
the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum

372
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:32,033
I found at Winterfell.

373
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:35,750
In the box you'll find a special gift.

374
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:39,267
Theon's favorite toy.

375
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:42,688
He cried when I took it away from him.

376
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:07,152
Leave the North now or more boxes will follow

377
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:09,732
with more Theon.

378
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:13,893
Signed Ramsay Snow,
natural-born son of Roose Bolton,

379
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,971
Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North. "

380
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:21,938
Get that out of my sight.

381
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,258
Theon disobeyed my orders.

382
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,273
The boy is a fool.

383
00:27:39,896 --> 00:27:43,240
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

384
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,836
I will not give up the lands I have seized,

385
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,037
the strongholds I have taken.

386
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:51,839
Get this away from me.

387
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:54,274
He's your son.

388
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:55,848
Son?

389
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,209
He's not a man anymore.

390
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,548
He's your son.

391
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:03,706
He's my brother.

392
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:06,246
He's a Greyjoy.

393
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:07,613
Watch yourself.

394
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:10,957
I've made my decision.

395
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,864
And I've made mine.

396
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:23,955
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.

397
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,750
<i>I'm going to choose the 50 best
killers on the Iron Islands.</i>

398
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:31,567
<i>Get those ropes!</i>

399
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,965
<i>I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea
all the way to the Weeping Water.</i>

400
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:40,403
<i>I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.</i>

401
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:43,171
<i>I'm going to find my little brother</i>

402
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,045
<i>and I'm going to bring him home.</i>

403
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
What is it?

404
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:57,277
Dragonglass.
We found them at the Fist.

405
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,627
Someone buried them a long time ago.

406
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,972
Someone wanted us to find them.

407
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,142
Why?

408
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,000
What are they for?

409
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,663
Killing white walkers.

410
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:14,933
How do you know that?

411
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:18,144
The walker came for my baby.

412
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:19,785
And Sam...

413
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:22,853
But no one's killed a white
walker in thousands of years.

414
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,188
Well...

415
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:27,462
I suppose someone had to be the first.

416
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:28,718
Take it, Hodor.

417
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,043
And the archer.

418
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,228
I got lucky

419
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:47,341
with one of them.

420
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,156
There are more.

421
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:52,053
Many more.

422
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:55,013
And for every one of them,

423
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,825
the dead men,

424
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,006
more than you could count.

425
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,013
I wish you'd come with us.

426
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:08,708
I wish I could.

427
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:11,734
I really do.

428
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,191
How are you keeping?

429
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,930
Great.

430
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,191
Never better.

431
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:08,200
It was just a bit of blood.

432
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,872
I should have known.

433
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:14,815
Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

434
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,514
We're not really people to you, are we? Just a
million different ways to get what you want.

435
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,914
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

436
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:22,675
I heard it.

437
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:27,187
A recent state of affairs.

438
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:33,740
I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.

439
00:31:35,122 --> 00:31:36,122
Sure, you were.

440
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:38,763
You're my friend. You're here to help.

441
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:40,727
I lived below the Street of Flour.

442
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,192
How far below?

443
00:31:42,623 --> 00:31:44,776
How close to the Red Keep were you?

444
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:48,613
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

445
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:51,376
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill

446
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:56,203
along Tanner's Row and right
in front of my front door

447
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:58,516
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

448
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,129
The Street of Steel,

449
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,486
with your armor and your knights?

450
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,720
You lived in the fancy part of town.

451
00:32:12,842 --> 00:32:14,042
And here we are now.

452
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:18,724
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

453
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:21,561
Yeah, we've come a long way.

454
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,280
We're all the same, really.

455
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:27,458
She went to great pains to point that out to me.

456
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,261
If you mistrust fancy people so much,
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

457
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:36,573
You're me.

458
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,266
Never been with a woman.

459
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:41,623
Never talked to a woman, really.

460
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,394
And then she comes at you...

461
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,108
big words, no clothes.

462
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:47,813
What would you have done?

463
00:32:49,736 --> 00:32:54,286
She does know her way around a
man's head, I'll give her that.

464
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,182
So how'd you become a lord?

465
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:04,392
- Oh, that's a long story.
- Better not, then.

466
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,610
I'm a bit busy.

467
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,379
Many years ago I helped King Stannis
out of a difficult situation.

468
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,709
He rewarded me with a lordship.

469
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,324
And this.

470
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
You see?

471
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,236
Highborns.

472
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,218
I didn't want to be a lord.

473
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,950
I nearly didn't accept.

474
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:37,076
- Why did you?
- I did it for my son.

475
00:33:38,857 --> 00:33:40,978
I didn't want him to step over a river of shit

476
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:43,007
every time he stepped through his front door.

477
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,365
I wanted him to have a better life.

478
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:50,718
Does he?

479
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:53,618
He's dead.

480
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:00,725
How'd he die?

481
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,139
Following me.

482
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,396
When did you come to this strange country?

483
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:23,374
- When I was 13.
- You were only a child.

484
00:34:24,902 --> 00:34:27,707
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

485
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,546
My mother made sure of that.

486
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:35,378
You've been a good influence
on our mutual friend, you know.

487
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:37,903
He used to drink from sundown to sunup,

488
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:42,216
visit three brothels a night,
gamble away his father's money.

489
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,082
Now it's just the drinking.

490
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,672
And now I'm his wife's servant.

491
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:50,861
I brush her hair and clip her nails
and empty her chamber pot.

492
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,704
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.

493
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,504
I love that girl.

494
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:56,735
I would kill for her.

495
00:34:57,209 --> 00:35:00,217
- Do you think that makes it easier for me?
- No.

496
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:01,247
I expect not.

497
00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:06,389
She's young and she's beautiful and...

498
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:09,443
- highborn.
- We break bread with them,

499
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:11,729
but that doesn't make us family.

500
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:16,702
We've learned their language,
but we'll never be their countrymen.

501
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:20,212
If you let yourself believe

502
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,793
that a foreign girl with no name could spend
her life with the son of Tywin Lannister...

503
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,989
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

504
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:29,937
As do I.

505
00:35:30,183 --> 00:35:32,770
Here only the family name matters.

506
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:35,478
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

507
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,272
Diamonds.

508
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,736
I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth,

509
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,829
but you know how to protect yourself.

510
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:48,688
Get on one of those ships.

511
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:51,823
Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

512
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:54,620
You can buy a house with these diamonds,

513
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:56,773
a very large house.

514
00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:58,832
Hire servants.

515
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:02,675
Start a new life,
a good life, far from here.

516
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:05,707
The mysterious foreign beauty.

517
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:07,976
You'll have suitors lining up.

518
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,074
Why do you want me to leave?

519
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:14,754
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive
who could make this country a better place.

520
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:18,858
He has the mind for it, he has the will,
he has the right last name. And you...

521
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,239
you are a complication.

522
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:26,855
I know you love him.

523
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,851
And I know it's true love not
bought by gold and silver.

524
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:33,600
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

525
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm asking you to leave

526
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,742
because your presence in the capital

527
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:40,681
endangers him.

528
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,332
This will never be your home, my lady.

529
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:49,748
Find a true home somewhere far from here...

530
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,369
while there's still time.

531
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:55,016
Lord Varys.

532
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:02,751
If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.

533
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:13,339
Keep up.

534
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:15,951
I don't think I can, my lord.

535
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:20,563
It's not easy being drunk all the time.

536
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:25,346
Everyone would do it if it were easy.

537
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:29,220
Leave.

538
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:40,096
So...

539
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:42,220
enjoying married life?

540
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,814
An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.

541
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:51,756
She doesn't deserve this.

542
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,005
Deserve?

543
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,485
Be careful with that.

544
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:59,403
Start trying to work out who deserves what

545
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:02,222
and before long
you'll spend the rest of your days

546
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:05,476
weeping for each and every person in the world.

547
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:09,342
There's nothing worse than a
late-blooming philosopher.

548
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,849
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras

549
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:15,757
with the same philosophical spirit?

550
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,448
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

551
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:22,074
I seem to remember saying something similar
about my own marriage.

552
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:23,745
You're not me.

553
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:29,051
You want to make things better for Sansa?
Give her a child.

554
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:33,452
So you can tell Father it was you
who finally talked me into it?

555
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:36,372
So she can have some happiness in her life.

556
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:38,746
You have children.

557
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:41,561
How happy would you say you are?

558
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,101
Not very.

559
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,291
But if it weren't for my children,

560
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,528
I'd have thrown myself from the
highest window in the Red Keep.

561
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,206
They're the reason I'm alive.

562
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:00,477
Even Joffrey?

563
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:03,245
Even Joffrey.

564
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:09,972
He was all I had once.

565
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:11,804
Before Myrcella was born.

566
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,785
I used to spend hours

567
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:19,677
looking at him.

568
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:23,449
His wisps of hair.

569
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:26,742
His tiny little hands and feet.

570
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:29,981
He was such a jolly little fellow.

571
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:36,779
You always hear the terrible
ones were terrible babies.

572
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:40,824
"We should have known. Even
then we should have known. " It's nonsense.

573
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,538
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

574
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:53,294
And no one can take that away from me,
not even Joffrey...

575
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,542
how it feels to have someone.

576
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,078
Someone of your own.

577
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,737
How long does it go on?

578
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,010
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

579
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:21,449
Every time we deal with an enemy,

580
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,273
we create two more.

581
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,399
Then I suppose it will go
on for quite a long time.

582
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:35,363
I'm telling you, that's what she did.

583
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:41,471
- Sounded like a cow in heat.
- Aye.

584
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:45,622
- Not for long. - That's right.
Black Walder shut her up right quick.

585
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,625
None of the Starks had much to
say about the end of that meal.

586
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,340
I'll tell you what, though.

587
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,951
The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.

588
00:40:54,373 --> 00:40:56,394
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

589
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:59,442
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

590
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:00,545
It was me.

591
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,830
And Malcolm and Talbott.

592
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,909
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

593
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:08,664
Took the skin right with it.

594
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:13,317
What we ended up having to do was hook the needle
right under the collarbone.

595
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,916
Give it a nice firm mooring and...

596
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:20,605
What do you want?

597
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,109
Mind if I keep warm?

598
00:41:22,556 --> 00:41:23,875
Fuck off.

599
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,379
But I'm hungry.

600
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:30,236
Does "fuck off" mean something
different where you're from?

601
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:31,343
I've got money.

602
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:37,854
What kind of coin is that?

603
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,134
It's worth a lot.

604
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:43,433
Sorry.

605
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,814
Little shit.

606
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:09,590
Where did you get the knife?

607
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:11,264
From you.

608
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,300
Is that the first man you've killed?

609
00:42:17,722 --> 00:42:18,876
The first man.

610
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,483
Next time you're going to do something like that,

611
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:25,162
tell me first.

612
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:38,616
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

613
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:11,003
Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.

614
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:16,509
You always knew who I was,

615
00:43:17,435 --> 00:43:18,435
what I am.

616
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:23,855
I have to go home now.

617
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,630
I know you won't hurt me.

618
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:32,246
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

619
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,816
I do know some things.

620
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:41,245
I know I love you.

621
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,960
I know you love me.

622
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:51,095
But I have to go home now.

623
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:34,377
I know how this must look.

624
00:44:37,685 --> 00:44:39,599
What I meant was...

625
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:43,009
- I swear to you, my lord...
- I'm not a lord, my dear.

626
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:45,352
Not for many, many years.

627
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,451
Every man who joins the Night's Watch

628
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:52,751
renounces all former titles.

629
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,760
Among other things.

630
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,864
What is your name?

631
00:45:02,517 --> 00:45:03,517
Gilly.

632
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,344
for the gillyflower.

633
00:45:07,982 --> 00:45:08,982
Lovely.

634
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:10,699
Yes, my...

635
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:14,767
Maester.

636
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:17,187
Master.

637
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:18,197
Maester.

638
00:45:19,628 --> 00:45:21,291
And the child?

639
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:25,174
She hasn't chosen a name yet.

640
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,722
His name is Sam.

641
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:32,164
Tarly...

642
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:36,355
do you remember the oath you swore

643
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:39,555
when you joined this order?

644
00:45:39,808 --> 00:45:41,958
He's not my child, Maester Aemon.

645
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:45,877
She's one of Craster's wives.

646
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:53,796
I remember every word of the oath.

647
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:58,318
Night gathers and my watch begins.

648
00:45:58,348 --> 00:46:01,448
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

649
00:46:04,023 --> 00:46:05,923
The realms of men.

650
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:10,435
That means her as well as us.

651
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,725
We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls,
700 feet high

652
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:17,735
to keep out men.

653
00:46:19,496 --> 00:46:22,396
The night is gathering, Maester Aemon,
I've seen it.

654
00:46:23,873 --> 00:46:26,023
It's coming for all of us.

655
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:29,921
Gilly,

656
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:31,959
you and your son

657
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:35,068
will be our guests for the time being.

658
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:38,070
We certainly cannot...

659
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,731
send you back

660
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:42,218
beyond the Wall.

661
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:43,865
Thank you...

662
00:46:44,756 --> 00:46:45,757
Maester.

663
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,499
- I can cook and clean and I can...
- Good.

664
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:51,706
Samwell...

665
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:55,041
fetch a quill and inkwell.

666
00:46:59,737 --> 00:47:03,715
I hope your penmanship is
better than your swordplay.

667
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:04,875
Miles better.

668
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:10,311
We had 44 ravens at last count.

669
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:13,204
Make sure they're all fed.

670
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:16,122
Every one of them flies tonight.

671
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,047
"To His Grace

672
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,276
King Stannis Baratheon.

673
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:35,541
Invaded- inv- invit- invited

674
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:38,411
to the name day...

675
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:40,698
celebration for...

676
00:47:41,908 --> 00:47:42,908
Rylene...

677
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:44,922
Florent

678
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:47,561
on the first nigit...

679
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:49,047
Night.

680
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:53,246
"First night of the full moon. "
Why is there a G in night?

681
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:55,156
I don't know. There just is.

682
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,890
Well, your father's not going to go to that.

683
00:47:59,987 --> 00:48:02,605
My books are better than these boring scrolls.

684
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:04,738
You could read about Balerion the Dread.

685
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:09,027
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

686
00:48:09,037 --> 00:48:10,688
I'd like to see that someday.

687
00:48:10,698 --> 00:48:14,348
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

688
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:17,468
"His fangs were as long as bastard swords. "

689
00:48:18,891 --> 00:48:20,998
<i>Aye, old Balerion's definitely
better than anything</i>

690
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:23,308
your cousin Rylene's got on offer.

691
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:28,795
But now that I'm your father's Hand again,
I have to keep him informed.

692
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:32,296
The king does not have time for this drudgery.

693
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:36,083
"To all the lords...

694
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,774
- and knobble men of Westeros. "
- Noblemen.

695
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:41,484
"Noblemen of Westeros,

696
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,888
the Nig... the Night's Watch...

697
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:49,775
implores...

698
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:52,018
What is it?

699
00:48:57,183 --> 00:48:59,033
Why are they ringing the bells?

700
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:00,982
Are we being attacked?

701
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:02,423
Stay here.

702
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,077
By the door.

703
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:26,261
The usurper Robb Stark is dead.

704
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,491
Betrayed by his bannerman.

705
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:33,385
And you take credit because you
dropped a leech into the fire?

706
00:49:33,395 --> 00:49:34,945
I take no credit.

707
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:38,097
I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.

708
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:43,052
Your Grace, the world...

709
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:45,284
has got so far bent.

710
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:50,204
I've seen things crawl out of nightmares,
but my eyes were open.

711
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:53,284
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

712
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:56,269
or because at war men die all the time,
but I do know...

713
00:49:56,299 --> 00:50:00,305
that uniting the Seven Kingdoms
with blood magic is wrong.

714
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:03,187
It is evil.
And you are not an evil man.

715
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:06,527
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

716
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,436
Aegon Targaryen.

717
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:11,039
And do you know how Aegon
Targaryen conquered Westeros?

718
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:13,787
On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.

719
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:18,419
He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced
and a smaller army,

720
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:21,980
but he had three dragons.
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

721
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:25,251
My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.

722
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,113
I will not forget that.

723
00:50:30,456 --> 00:50:32,064
I will not forgive that.

724
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:37,984
I will punish them with any arms
at my disposal.

725
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:40,575
You do not need to burn the boy.

726
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:44,048
If what you say is true,

727
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,095
a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark...

728
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,947
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

729
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,708
A great gift requires a great sacrifice.

730
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:14,404
His name is Gendry.

731
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:16,936
He's a good lad.

732
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:22,684
A poor lad from Flea Bottom
who happens to be your nephew.

733
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:31,723
What is the life of one bastard
boy against a kingdom?

734
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:34,704
Everything.

735
00:51:35,966 --> 00:51:37,618
The boy must die.

736
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:47,480
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

737
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:52,411
- Is this some kind of trick?
- Yes, but not on you.

738
00:51:56,973 --> 00:51:58,769
Aim for that star.

739
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:02,344
Don't stop.
There's bread and water. Go slow with it.

740
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,571
If you finish it off,
no matter how thirsty you get,

741
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,086
- don't drink seawater.
- I know not to drink seawater.

742
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:14,817
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

743
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:18,000
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

744
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,492
- Where should I go?
- You must keep the coast on your left side

745
00:52:20,522 --> 00:52:24,026
- until you reach King's Landing.
- The gold cloaks are looking for me.

746
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:27,061
They were looking for me for 20 years.
Do they know your face?

747
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:29,923
- No.
- I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

748
00:52:36,558 --> 00:52:38,181
The other way.

749
00:52:42,317 --> 00:52:44,542
You ever been in a boat before?

750
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:47,381
- No.
- You know how to swim?

751
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:50,108
- No.
- Don't fall out.

752
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,903
Go on.

753
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,835
- Why are you doing this?
- Because it's right.

754
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,312
And because I'm a slow learner.

755
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:07,133
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

756
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:14,377
<i>Horse approaching!</i>

757
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,941
Halt! Halt!

758
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:37,216
Jon! Jon! Jon it's us.

759
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:39,309
I don't think he can see us.

760
00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:45,049
Pyp?

761
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:50,624
- Sam?
- Hush, now.

762
00:53:51,455 --> 00:53:52,844
You're home.

763
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:56,998
Carry him inside. Gently.

764
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:24,242
Out of the way.

765
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:28,297
Step aside, country boy.
People working here.

766
00:55:14,004 --> 00:55:15,134
Cersei.

767
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:35,998
You don't deny it?

768
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:38,266
No.

769
00:55:39,517 --> 00:55:41,067
I let him go.

770
00:55:41,978 --> 00:55:44,778
Your mercy saved the boy's life.

771
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:48,677
<i>- You feel good about that?
- Aye, I do.</i>

772
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,645
You saved one innocent.

773
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:54,223
How many tens of thousands have you doomed?

774
00:55:57,736 --> 00:55:59,807
There has got to be another way.

775
00:56:00,138 --> 00:56:03,137
What other way?!
Tell us about this other way.

776
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:04,917
I don't know, Your Grace.

777
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,259
I can't see the future in the fire.

778
00:56:12,184 --> 00:56:14,334
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.

779
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:17,714
I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,

780
00:56:17,744 --> 00:56:21,096
First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men, sentence you to die.

781
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,176
I understand.

782
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:27,006
But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of
the King, it is my duty to advise you against it.

783
00:56:27,444 --> 00:56:29,944
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

784
00:56:31,483 --> 00:56:33,883
Why am I gonna need you?

785
00:56:37,158 --> 00:56:38,158
My king.

786
00:56:42,794 --> 00:56:45,112
It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.

787
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:46,788
Their Lord Commander is dead.

788
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:49,657
Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.

789
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:51,087
One lad did, though.

790
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:54,489
What he saw beyond the Wall...

791
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,661
it's coming for all of us.

792
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:12,952
When did you learn to read?

793
00:57:12,982 --> 00:57:17,136
Matthos taught me before he died
so I could be of better service to you.

794
00:57:24,118 --> 00:57:27,368
This War of Five Kings means nothing.

795
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:31,246
The true war lies to the north, my king.

796
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:35,181
Death marches on the Wall.

797
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:37,765
Only you can stop him.

798
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,197
You can't stop him alone.

799
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:42,925
You need someone to rebuild your army for you,

800
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:45,307
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

801
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:48,019
to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.

802
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:49,849
I've made my decision.

803
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:52,727
He's right.

804
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:54,734
You need him.

805
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:58,114
He has a part to play in the war to come.

806
00:58:06,536 --> 00:58:08,086
You see, Ser Davos?

807
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:13,481
You've been saved by that
fire god you like to mock.

808
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:18,082
You're in his army now.

809
00:58:41,115 --> 00:58:42,915
They will come, Your Grace.

810
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:45,038
When they're ready.

811
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,630
Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

812
00:58:47,672 --> 00:58:49,322
You didn't conquer them.

813
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:51,113
You liberated them.

814
00:58:52,757 --> 00:58:55,557
People learn to love their chains.

815
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:58,007
No.
