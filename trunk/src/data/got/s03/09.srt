1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,552
You think I can't hear you every day

2
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:05,976
talking about visions
and three-eyed ravens and black magic?

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,504
I don't want you talking to him
till we get to Castle Black.

4
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,959
We're not going to Castle Black.
Jon Snow isn't there.

5
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,670
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,001
Oh, no, I'm not going back there.

7
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,473
I promised your maester I'd get you
to Castle Black

8
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:17,668
and no further.

9
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:20,116
You won't win. You don't have the discipline.

10
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,397
- You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.

11
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:24,991
If you attack the Wall you'll die, all of you.

12
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,292
All of us.

13
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,120
I can't force them to meet us in the field.

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,306
Casterly Rock can't run away.

15
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,719
Can you do it?

16
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:35,769
There is only one person in this kingdom
with that kind of army.

17
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:40,043
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

18
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,389
Our father requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters.

19
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:46,314
- You were sent here to kill me?
- I don't want to.

20
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:49,018
What do your captains have to say about that?

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,854
You should ask them.

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,755
Will you fight for me?

23
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,488
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

24
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,465
My sword is yours, my life is yours,

25
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:00,130
my heart is yours.

26
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,772
- Is that the Blackwater?
- Where do you think I'm taking you?

27
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,325
- Back to King's Landing.
- That's the Red Fork.

28
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,073
I'm taking you to the Twins.

29
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:10,357
Your uncle's marrying one of the Frey girls.

30
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,822
Your mother and brother will be there

31
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:14,613
and they'll pay me for you.

32
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:16,798
That rain will cost us another day.

33
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,762
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

34
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,203
- He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.

35
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,953
It was a king he wanted.

36
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,699
It's come for the baby.

37
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,308
You stay back!

38
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,452
No, you can't have him.

39
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:33,482
No!

40
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:55,726

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,566
Are you sure about this?

45
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,420
No.

46
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,595
It's dangerous.

47
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:01,792
If we take Tywin's castle from him,

48
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,775
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

49
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,115
Take his home,
take his gold, take his power.

50
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,064
Why are you telling me?

51
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:18,778
You begged me not to send Theon
to negotiate with his father

52
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:21,035
and I ignored your advice.

53
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:25,283
Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground,

54
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,417
the North is overrun with ironborn,

55
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,513
and Bran and Rickon are gone.

56
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,786
So Casterly Rock...

57
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,244
I'm asking your advice.

58
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,134
We have enough men?

59
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,847
If Walder Frey cooperates.

60
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,942
If Walder Frey cooperates.

61
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:05,296
If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing

62
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,530
before we take the castle...

63
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:12,318
we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.

64
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,013
We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.

65
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:23,006
Or worse.

66
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:31,681
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

67
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:04,498
My honored guests...

68
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:08,530
be welcome within my walls

69
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,401
and at my table.

70
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:15,258
I extend to you my hospitality

71
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,963
and protection in the light of the Seven.

72
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,799
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

73
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,639
I have come to make my apologies, my lord,

74
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,771
and to beg your forgiveness.

75
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,803
Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.

76
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:38,053
It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.

77
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,337
One of them was supposed to be queen.

78
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,347
Now none of them are.

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,337
This is Arwyen...

80
00:06:58,796 --> 00:06:59,936
my daughter.

81
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:02,059
My daughter Walda,

82
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,391
my daughter Derwa,

83
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:07,121
my daughter Waldra.

84
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:13,754
My eldest granddaughters

85
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,159
Ginea...

86
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:17,179
and Nehila.

87
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,948
Serra e Sarra...

88
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:23,218
granddaughters, twins.

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,538
You could have had either.

90
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,607
Could have had both for all I care.

91
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,921
My granddaughter Marianne.

92
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,647
My granddaughter Freya.

93
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,980
My granddaughter...

94
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,666
Wertha.

95
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,658
Waldra.

96
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:46,467
Waldina.

97
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:48,683
- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

98
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:52,099
And here's my youngest daughter...

99
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:53,800
Shirei.

100
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,407
Though she hasn't bled yet.

101
00:07:56,437 --> 00:08:00,187
Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.

102
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,634
My ladies.

103
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,976
All men should keep their word,

104
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,741
kings most of all.

105
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,987
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

106
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,772
The fault is not with you.

107
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:15,207
Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.

108
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:18,370
I did what I did not to slight you,

109
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,302
but because I loved another.

110
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:24,614
I know these words cannot set right
the wrong I have done to you and your house.

111
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,527
I beg your forgiveness

112
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,865
and pledge to do all I can to make amends

113
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:35,449
so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks
of Winterfell may once again be friends.

114
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,607
Very good.

115
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,695
There she is.

116
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:50,676
Come closer.

117
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,019
Let me have a look at you.

118
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:01,735
Still can't see you.

119
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,292
Old eyes.

120
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,798
Love.

121
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,991
That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?

122
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,152
Very honorable.

123
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,689
I call it a pretty face.

124
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,242
Very pretty.

125
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,330
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.

126
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,745
Very shapely as well.

127
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:47,507
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.

128
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:51,891
If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have
brought her here in the first place.

129
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:02,406
I can always see
what's going on beneath a dress.

130
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:04,943
Been at this a long time.

131
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:09,148
I bet when you take that dress off,

132
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:11,586
everything stays right where it is.

133
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Doesn't drop an inch.

134
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:18,559
Your king says he betrayed me for love.

135
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:24,037
I say he betrayed me for firm tits
and a tight fit.

136
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:27,421
And I can respect that.

137
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,350
When I was your age,

138
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,497
I'd have broken 50 oaths

139
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:35,977
to get into that without a second thought.

140
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:42,954
Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.

141
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:47,634
We'll set up tents outside
with food and ale for the rest of your men.

142
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:49,208
Thank you, my lord.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,357
Well, let's get ready.

144
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,702
The wine will flow red

145
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,776
and the music will play loud

146
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,531
and we'll put this mess...

147
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,048
behind us.

148
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,628
Where?

149
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:15,934
There.

150
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:24,946
There.

151
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:26,826
It's a back gate.

152
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:29,279
My men use it when
they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

153
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:31,122
Your men, but not you?

154
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,848
I have no interest in slaves.

155
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,878
A man cannot make love to property.

156
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,082
This is where we enter the city.

157
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:42,744
Very few guards. They know me.
They let me inside...

158
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:45,214
We're not gonna sneak an army
through a back gate.

159
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,134
I kill the guards. I take your two best men

160
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:51,186
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

161
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,237
and open the front gates.

162
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,386
Then comes the army.

163
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,175
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

164
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,993
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm
and me to the slaughter,

165
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,862
cutting the head off our army.

166
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:06,265
The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee

167
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,000
and you won't have to split it three ways
'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.

168
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,205
You have a very suspicious mind.

169
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:16,469
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

170
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,431
You command the Unsullied.

171
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:22,082
What do you think?

172
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,556
You leave tonight.

173
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,197
Very good.

174
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,032
We'll prepare.

175
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,738
Ser Jorah.

176
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,839
You can use an extra sword.

177
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,196
You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.

178
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,047
Your place is by the queen.

179
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,516
If we are truly her loyal servants,

180
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,585
we'll do whatever needs to be done

181
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:03,756
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

182
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:09,329
We're west of Castle Black,

183
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,754
but the Nightfort's closest to us.

184
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,747
It was the first castle on the Wall.

185
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,253
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

186
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:21,674
Too big. Impossible to maintain.

187
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:24,043
Other than Castle Black itself,

188
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:26,792
the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.

189
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:30,049
It's got a secret sally port,

190
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,817
the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.

191
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:36,455
No one's used it in centuries most likely.

192
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,157
It leads through the Wall

193
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,092
right down into the Nightfort,

194
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:42,994
if one knows how to find it,

195
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,930
which, it just so happens, I do.

196
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,287
How do you know all that?

197
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,395
I read about it in a...

198
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,475
a very old book.

199
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,314
You know all that

200
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:07,283
from staring at marks on paper?

201
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,352
Yes.

202
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,156
You're like a wizard.

203
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,342
Our father used to tell us

204
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:34,747
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

205
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:37,283
Here we are.

206
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,653
Alive.

207
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,984
Remember what happens to children who run.

208
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,755
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

209
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,908
The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they?

210
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:16,038
Cracked three spokes this morning.

211
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:19,068
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

212
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:24,190
Got to get this salt pork to the Twins
in time for the wedding.

213
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:27,334
Many thanks.

214
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:30,557
Don't!

215
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,694
Don't kill him.

216
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,608
Dead rats don't squeak.

217
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,310
You're so dangerous, aren't you?

218
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,725
Saying scary things to little girls.

219
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,181
Killing little boys and old people.

220
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:42,751
A real hard man you are.

221
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,651
More than anyone you know.

222
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,420
You're wrong. I know a killer.

223
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,708
- A real killer.
- That so?

224
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:51,838
You'd be like a kitten to him.

225
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:54,094
He'd kill you with his little finger.

226
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:55,476
That him?

227
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,632
- No.
- Good.

228
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:02,602
Don't kill him.

229
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,879
Please.

230
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:06,392
Please don't.

231
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,470
You're very kind.

232
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,779
Someday it'll get you killed.

233
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:32,254
Where are we?

234
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:35,059
The Gift, I think.

235
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,068
Brandon the Builder gave all this land
south of the Wall to the Night's Watch

236
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,252
for their sustenance and support.

237
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,977
Maester Luwin taught me that.

238
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:49,091
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

239
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,928
It's good land and there's no war up here.

240
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,926
- Why leave?
- Wildlings.

241
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:56,876
Sorry.

242
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:01,694
But they come over the Wall and raid,
steal, carry off women.

243
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:05,858
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup
and make you drink your own blood from it.

244
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,321
That's what Old Nan said.

245
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,586
There's a storm coming.

246
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:14,681
I don't see any...

247
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,583
It's as good a place to shelter as any.

248
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,088
We can drink some blood while we wait.

249
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,575
I don't need much.

250
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,025
Only one old man and eight good horses.

251
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,138
What's one old man doing with eight horses?

252
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:48,132
He breeds them for the Watch.

253
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,986
How's he keep folks from stealing them?

254
00:17:50,453 --> 00:17:52,606
The Watch protects him.

255
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,151
Not today they don't.

256
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:57,856
He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.

257
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,472
- And proper steel.
- Let's carve him up.

258
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,307
We just take the horses and go.

259
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,542
The old man's no threat.

260
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,105
I keep telling you.

261
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:08,800
He's an old man.

262
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,765
A spear through the heart's a better way to die

263
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:14,093
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

264
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:19,223
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

265
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,373
They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

266
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,445
I hope so.

267
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:26,742
Killing crows in their castle is tough.

268
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,445
Killing them out here in the open,
that's what we do.

269
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,981
Spread out.
Surround the hut...

270
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:35,011
and move in.

271
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,916
Ygritte!

272
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,000
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

273
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:04,940
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

274
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,949
Best part of the animal.

275
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,254
Don't worry. They're still there.

276
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,678
I know they're still there.

277
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,426
You check every five minutes
like you're afraid they're gonna move.

278
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:23,790
- I'm not afraid.
- Of course you are.

279
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,479
You're almost there

280
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,376
and you're afraid you won't make it.

281
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:32,949
The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.

282
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,254
No point in trying to hide behind that face.

283
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,127
I know fear when I see it.

284
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:41,185
Seen it a lot.

285
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:45,136
I knew fear when I saw it in you.

286
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:48,343
You're afraid of fire.

287
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:53,625
When Beric's sword went up in flames,
you looked like a scared little girl.

288
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,540
And I know why, too.

289
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,056
I heard what your brother did to you.

290
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,915
Pressed your face to the fire
like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

291
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,178
That give you some ideas?

292
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,442
Might do.

293
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,355
Go ahead, then.

294
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,386
You might get away.

295
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,434
Might even make it there on your own.

296
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:30,355
They're just over the river.

297
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,309
The closest you've been to family since

298
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,492
Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

299
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:42,347
Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye

300
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:44,055
and out the back of your skull.

301
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,601
How are we going to get past the Wall?

302
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,476
My uncle said it's 700 feet high.

303
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:21,157
How did you get past it?

304
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:28,229
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

305
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,357
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

306
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:33,265
Some climb straight up the ice.

307
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,602
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

308
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,176
19 castles guard the Wall.

309
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,684
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!

310
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,969
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

311
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,410
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

312
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,432
when the castles were deserted.

313
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,462
Well, we'll have to open them up again.

314
00:22:57,872 --> 00:22:59,814
There's a rider out there.

315
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,191
Just one?

316
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,494
- There's more.
- Hodor!

317
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,133
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

318
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:11,963
<i>I yield.</i>

319
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,503
<i>- I yield.
- Wildlings.</i>

320
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:22,243
- Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
- Hunting.

321
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,474
Shh, quiet, Hodor.

322
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,291
Make him shut up. If they hear us...

323
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,714
Hush, Hodor. No... no more Hodoring.

324
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:34,307
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

325
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:36,393
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

326
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,441
<i>Hodor, be quiet.</i>

327
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:41,666
Hodor, calm down.

328
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:44,702
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

329
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:08,733
What did you do?

330
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:10,704
Nothing.

331
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:12,679
I don't know.

332
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:19,514
What's that?

333
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:22,099
That's a horse dying.

334
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,457
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

335
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:37,936
<i>That was the last of them. The rest are dead.</i>

336
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,894
I heard shouting up there.

337
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,463
Thunder.

338
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:45,494
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

339
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:47,502
Maybe it's ghosts.

340
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:00,798
That won't help you, grandpa.

341
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:06,948
Where you riding?

342
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,086
Doesn't matter now, does it?

343
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,753
No, it doesn't matter now.

344
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:16,858
Cut his throat
or he'll tell the crows we're here.

345
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:24,570
You understand.

346
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,677
Let me stand at least.

347
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:30,222
Let me go with a bit of dignity.

348
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,886
Make the crow kill him.

349
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:43,073
You're one of us now. Prove it.

350
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:49,550
The wolves are out there.

351
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:55,407
I can't do it by choice.

352
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:59,141
I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.

353
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,162
You're a warg, Bran.

354
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,673
It's in your blood.

355
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:06,711
- I can't.
- You just did with him.

356
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:09,398
A wolf is nothing compared to that.

357
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,290
She looks sharp.

358
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,233
Do it.

359
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:31,972
Do it.

360
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:35,399
I told you. He's still one of them.

361
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,378
Go on, boy.

362
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:43,582
Go on!

363
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:55,919
He's a crow.
He'll always be a crow.

364
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,700
And here's his crow wife guarding him.

365
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:01,878
He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.

366
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:05,803
Kill him.

367
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,820
- He's one of them.
- No!

368
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:25,501
Do you hear me?

369
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:34,975
You're not gonna die for one of them.

370
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:37,999
Do it.

371
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,537
They'll find us if you don't.

372
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,655
You were right the whole time.

373
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:03,023
<i>When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come.</i>

374
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,693
I'm a great whistler.

375
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,473
The greatest in the land.

376
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:13,829
Daario Naharis.

377
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,510
That one was quick.

378
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,628
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

379
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:53,438
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

380
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:39,761
That's what you call a few guards?

381
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,179
Come on! What do you got, huh?

382
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:21,856
Lord Edmure...

383
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,430
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

384
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:38,234
You're a delight to me, my lady.

385
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:44,142
You may now cloak the bride
and bring her under your protection.

386
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,624
In the sight of the Seven,

387
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:17,685
I hereby seal these two souls,

388
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:20,352
binding them as one...

389
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:21,662
for eternity.

390
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:24,829
Look upon each other and say the words.

391
00:33:27,496 --> 00:33:30,846
Father, Smith, Warrior,

392
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:35,156
Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

393
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:37,226
- I am hers...
- I am his...

394
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,254
- and she is mine...
- and he is mine...

395
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,064
- ... from this day
- ... from this day

396
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:45,115
until the end of my days.

397
00:33:48,016 --> 00:33:49,327
Is that safe?

398
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:51,237
They're long gone.

399
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,321
You were right.

400
00:33:57,351 --> 00:34:00,651
I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.

401
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:01,911
Of course you can.

402
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:07,803
North of the Wall there are wildlings
who can control all sorts of animals.

403
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,919
But you did a lot more than that.

404
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:14,791
You got inside Hodor's mind.

405
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:19,770
They can't do that north of the Wall?

406
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,754
No one can do that...

407
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,134
anywhere.

408
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:33,173
When I was looking through Summer's eyes,

409
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:34,923
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

410
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,353
He was with the wildlings.

411
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,646
They tried to kill him, but he got away.

412
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:41,053
He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then.

413
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,403
That's where we should go.

414
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,148
For all we know,
Castle Black's already under attack.

415
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:47,952
- If this many wildlings got through...
- I already told you.

416
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:50,182
I'm not going north of the Wall.

417
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:53,285
Everything Jojen told me is true.

418
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,016
You saw what I did to Hodor.

419
00:34:57,026 --> 00:34:58,837
I have to find the three-eyed raven.

420
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,897
- Listen to me, little lord.
- Don't worry.

421
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,914
I'm not asking you to come with me.

422
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:08,631
It won't be safe for Rickon.

423
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:10,183
Me?

424
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,263
I'm coming with you.
- No.

425
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:16,765
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

426
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:18,428
The Umbers are our bannermen.

427
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:19,686
They'll protect you.

428
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:20,996
I'm coming with you.

429
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:23,592
I'm your brother.

430
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,197
I have to protect you.

431
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:30,757
Right now I have to protect you.

432
00:35:31,747 --> 00:35:34,752
Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.

433
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:36,656
If something happens to us,

434
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,816
you're the heir to Winterfell.

435
00:35:41,187 --> 00:35:43,325
Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?

436
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,685
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

437
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,146
You're easy to find.

438
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,259
We're not southerners.

439
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:53,873
And I don't want to leave you.

440
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:56,964
Come here, little soldier.

441
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,331
You and me...

442
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,583
we're gonna have some adventures.

443
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:03,995
You don't have to do any of this.

444
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,019
Your family took me in

445
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:09,250
and was good to me when they had no cause to be.

446
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,435
We'll be fine, you and me.

447
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,215
The Umbers are great warriors.

448
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,606
Even I heard about them growing up.

449
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:21,358
They'll teach you how to swing a sword.

450
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:24,518
I know how to swing a sword.

451
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,378
You're leaving now?

452
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,870
It's the middle of the night.
- I learned to walk in darkness.

453
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:40,784
Say your good-byes, little man.

454
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:50,519
Keep this one safe.

455
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:54,586
He means the world to me.

456
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:17,706
We've been waiting a long time.

457
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:21,744
Haven't we?

458
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:25,139
I don't know, you tell me.

459
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:27,500
How long does it take to sack a city?

460
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:38,325
It was just as you said.

461
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:41,396
They did not believe until it was too late.

462
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,156
Their slave soldiers

463
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:45,914
threw down their spears and surrendered.

464
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:53,270
And Daario Naharis?

465
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:16,165
The city is yours, my queen.

466
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,275
They're good, aren't they?

467
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,731
They ought to be because they cost enough.

468
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,228
Look at the crowd there.

469
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:01,543
He complained about this marriage
the entire ride from Riverrun,

470
00:39:01,553 --> 00:39:02,686
and now look at him.

471
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:05,070
The gods love to reward a fool.

472
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:06,663
- Uncle.
- What?

473
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:09,635
He's my nephew. I love him.

474
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,469
And he's a damned fool.

475
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,891
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

476
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,516
Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.

477
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,376
That's the point.

478
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,872
Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?

479
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:27,882
Aye.

480
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,939
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

481
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:34,519
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

482
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:36,728
So I have a fat young bride.

483
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:40,172
I hope she makes you very happy.

484
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:42,235
Well, she's made me very rich.

485
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:44,632
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

486
00:39:44,768 --> 00:39:47,051
I need to find a tree to piss on.

487
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,604
My mother's alone with Roose Bolton.

488
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:53,312
I should rescue her.

489
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:56,593
Your mother is less in need of rescue
than any woman I've ever met.

490
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,703
Be kind.

491
00:39:58,177 --> 00:40:00,477
She's finally starting to like you.

492
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:03,406
And I like her.

493
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:06,904
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

494
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:09,856
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

495
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:13,335
eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.

496
00:40:13,598 --> 00:40:15,898
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

497
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,857
Striking your king is an act of treason.

498
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,859
No, don't.

499
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,200
Don't insult them.

500
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:33,044
Your Grace.

501
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:43,549
The septon has prayed his prayers,

502
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:46,601
some words were said,

503
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:48,249
and Lord Edmure

504
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:51,405
has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.

505
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:52,504
But...

506
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:55,046
they are not yet man and wife.

507
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:58,069
A sword needs a sheath.

508
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,846
And a wedding needs a bedding.

509
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,965
What does my sire say?

510
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:12,960
<i>To bed! To bed! To bed!</i>

511
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:22,875
If you think the time is right, Lord Walder,
by all means,

512
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:25,554
let us bed them.

513
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,450
<i>To bed! To bed! To bed!</i>

514
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:41,765
<i>Go on!</i>

515
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:03,633
Careful now, ladies.

516
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:05,695
Once you set that monster free,

517
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:08,275
there's no caging him again.

518
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:12,883
<i>To bed! To bed! To bed!</i>

519
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:16,922
Poor girl.

520
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,337
Every bride suffers the same.

521
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,773
I'm sure you endured yours with grace.

522
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:24,253
Oh, Ned forbade it.

523
00:42:25,525 --> 00:42:30,475
He said it wouldn't be right if he broke
a man's jaw on our wedding night.

524
00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:39,569
That is a very strange custom.

525
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:44,061
I suppose it does seem strange
from a foreigner's perspective.

526
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:45,491
It seems normal to you?

527
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:48,043
It's a tradition.

528
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:53,336
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

529
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:55,307
the lord and lady consummated their marriage.

530
00:42:55,337 --> 00:42:58,606
But there are other ways of providing proof.

531
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:02,693
Boy or girl?

532
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,690
I don't know.

533
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:08,677
But if it's a boy,

534
00:43:08,707 --> 00:43:10,077
I know what we should name him.

535
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:11,157
Oh, do you?

536
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:15,793
It seems to me the father should
have some say in his son's naming.

537
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:16,823
Eddard.

538
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:24,821
Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark
how to ride horses?

539
00:43:25,732 --> 00:43:26,878
I do.

540
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:25,455
<i>Go on, line 'em up!</i>

541
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:49,212
Where are you going?

542
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:51,355
Got salt pork for the feast.

543
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:53,035
The feast is over.

544
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:55,712
Doesn't sound like it's over.

545
00:44:56,044 --> 00:44:57,809
If I tell you it's over,

546
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,539
it's over.

547
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:02,216
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

548
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,508
Got pig's feet, too.

549
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:08,254
Are you soft in the head?

550
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:10,325
Turn this cart around.

551
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,188
Your Grace.

552
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:32,638
I feel I've been...

553
00:45:32,976 --> 00:45:34,676
remiss...

554
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:35,988
in my duties.

555
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:40,078
I've given you meat and wine and music,

556
00:45:40,108 --> 00:45:41,774
but I haven't

557
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:45,431
shown you the hospitality you deserve.

558
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:51,550
My king has married
and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

559
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:58,084
Robb!

560
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:48,682
You ready to head home to Winterfell, right?

561
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:54,627
<i>Feast over yet, is it?
Aye, it's over.</i>

562
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,209
Follow him.

563
00:47:30,277 --> 00:47:31,281
Aim!

564
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:02,483
It's too late.

565
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:47,158
The King in the North arises.

566
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,330
Lord Walder!

567
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:12,876
Lord Walder, enough!

568
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,080
Let it end!

569
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,310
Please.

570
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:20,719
He is my son.

571
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:23,420
My first son.

572
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:26,544
Let him go and I swear that we will forget this.

573
00:49:26,574 --> 00:49:28,952
I swear it by the old gods and new.

574
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:30,436
We will take no vengeance.

575
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:34,184
You already swore me one oath
right here in my castle.

576
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:37,915
You swore by all the gods your
son would marry my daughter!

577
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:39,545
Take me for a hostage,

578
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:41,284
but let Robb go.

579
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:43,054
Robb, get up.

580
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,058
Get up and walk out.

581
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:47,175
Please!

582
00:49:49,275 --> 00:49:50,700
Please!

583
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:55,768
And why would I let him do that?

584
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:00,835
On my honor as a Tully,

585
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:03,844
on my honor as a Stark,

586
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:06,639
let him go

587
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,899
or I will cut your wife's throat.

588
00:50:18,692 --> 00:50:21,192
I'll find another.

589
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:25,227
Mother.

590
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:29,888
The Lannisters send their regards.

591
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:18,478
