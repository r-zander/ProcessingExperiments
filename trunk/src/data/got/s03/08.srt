1
00:00:01,172 --> 00:00:03,831
Is the Wall as big as they say?

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,129
Bigger.

3
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:07,299
- How much longer?
- A few more days.

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,951
I found something at the Fist of the First Men.

5
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,089
What does it do?

6
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:13,590
I'm not sure that it does anything.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,307
You're not supposed to be here.

8
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,208
- If your father knew.
- He said you're a traitor.

9
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,394
I am, child.

10
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,070
You must get bored down here.

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,563
I brought you something to read.

12
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,148
My lady, I can't read the words.

13
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:25,399
I wouldn't know where to start.
- At the beginning.

14
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,069
This word is Aegon.

15
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:29,460
The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.

16
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,698
We can defeat them.

17
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:33,846
But they won't meet us on the field.
They have strong walls.

18
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,592
Women in our position must make the best
of our circumstances.

19
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:45,409
How do I make the best of my circumstances?

20
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,130
I have to marry him.

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,938
I didn't ask for this marriage.

22
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:51,793
I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.

23
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:54,930
My feelings for you have not changed.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,932
Listen to me, my lady.

25
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,601
I'm not your lady. I'm your whore.

26
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,241
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

27
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,539
You are mad.

28
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,944
We have powerful friends. Friends who would take
great pleasure in destroying you.

29
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:11,196
Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

30
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,341
He said he had powerful friends.

31
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:17,714
Who was he talking about?
- I don't know.

32
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,744
Find out.

33
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:21,373
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

34
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:22,947
Your blood is noble.

35
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:24,226
I'm just a bastard.

36
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,917
The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon.

37
00:01:26,947 --> 00:01:28,974
There is power in a king's blood.

38
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,696
You're a liar!
You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.

39
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:32,726
Now...

40
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:35,804
<i>- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!</i>

41
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,562
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

42
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:44,445
Won't do you no good.

43
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,516

47
00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:17,241
I'll give you one try, girl.

48
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,012
Kill me and you're free.

49
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:23,967
But if I live,

50
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,918
I'll break both your hands.

51
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:29,811
Go on, hit me.

52
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,122
Hit me hard.

53
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:44,673
Sulk all you want.

54
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,187
The truth is, you're lucky.

55
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,438
You don't want to be alone out here, girl.

56
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:53,757
Someone worse than me would find you.

57
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,043
There's no one worse than you.

58
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,239
You never knew my brother.

59
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,726
He once killed a man for snoring.

60
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,951
There's plenty worse than me.

61
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,935
There's men who like to beat little girls,

62
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,507
men who like to rape them.

63
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,653
I saved your sister from some of them.

64
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:13,234
You're lying.

65
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,361
Ask her, if you ever see her again.

66
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,124
Ask her who came back for her

67
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,833
when the mob had her on her back.

68
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:23,533
They would have taken her every which way

69
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:26,281
and left her there with her throat cut open.

70
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,274
Is that the Blackwater?
The Blackwater?

71
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,255
Where do you think I'm taking you?

72
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,514
Back to King's Landing...

73
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:43,444
to Joffrey and the queen.

74
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,124
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen.

75
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,826
That's the Red Fork.

76
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,992
I'm taking you to the Twins.

77
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:53,131
But why?

78
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:56,268
Because your mother and brother will be there

79
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,435
and they'll pay me for you.

80
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:03,029
Why would they be at the Twins?

81
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,813
Those outlaws you love so much never told you?

82
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:09,238
The whole countryside is yapping about it.

83
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:13,310
Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.

84
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:18,808
So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might
just make it there in time for the wedding.

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,786
Men who fight for gold have
neither honor nor loyalty.

86
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,313
They cannot be trusted.

87
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:44,028
They can be trusted to
kill you if they're well paid.

88
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,975
The Yunkish are paying them well.

89
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,919
You know these men?

90
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,097
Only by the broken swords on their banners.

91
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:53,462
They're called the Second Sons.

92
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:57,078
A company led by a Braavosi named Mero,

93
00:06:57,245 --> 00:06:59,062
"The Titan's Bastard. "

94
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,464
Is he more titan or bastard?

95
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,767
He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

96
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,190
They all are.

97
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,173
How many?

98
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,161
2,000, Your Grace.

99
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:13,478
Armored and mounted.

100
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:16,187
Enough to make a difference?

101
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,580
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

102
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,043
I'm sure the sellswords prefer
to fight for the winning side.

103
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,872
I imagine you're right.

104
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:31,957
I'd like to talk to the Titan's
Bastard about winning.

105
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:33,900
He may not agree to meet.

106
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,067
He will.

107
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:39,307
A man who fights for gold can't
afford to lose to a girl.

108
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:40,669
<i>Your Grace...</i>

109
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,893
allow me to present
the captains of the Second Sons.

110
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,346
Mero of Braavos,

111
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:49,624
Prendahl na Ghezn,

112
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,688
and...

113
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,911
Daario Naharis.

114
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:00,927
You are the Mother of Dragons?

115
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,236
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

116
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,072
- Mind your tongue.
- Why?

117
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:08,738
I didn't mind hers.

118
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,633
She licked my ass like she was born to do it.

119
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:18,511
You, slave girl, bring wine.

120
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,259
We have no slaves here.

121
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:24,921
You'll all be slaves after the battle
unless I save you.

122
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,522
Take your clothes off and
come and sit on Mero's lap

123
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,357
and I may give you my Second Sons.

124
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,222
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

125
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,515
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

126
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:39,664
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

127
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,673
We have more, don't we?

128
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:43,783
10,000 Unsullied.

129
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:46,266
I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war,

130
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,592
but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself

131
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,679
can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.

132
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,316
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

133
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,391
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

134
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:03,283
- You're very young to be a captain.
- He's not a captain.

135
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:04,669
He's a lieutenant.

136
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,690
Even if your numbers are right,
you must admit the odds don't favor your side.

137
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,128
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.

138
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:14,745
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.

139
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:17,835
Or you could fight for me.

140
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,181
We've taken the slavers' gold.

141
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,945
We fight for Yunkai.

142
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,248
I would pay you as much and more.

143
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,418
Our contract is our bond.

144
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:34,155
If we break our bond,
no one will hire the Second Sons again.

145
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,429
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

146
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:42,459
You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your
choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

147
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,662
You have no ships. You have no siege weapons.

148
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,701
You have no cavalry.

149
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:49,270
A fortnight ago, I had no army.

150
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,639
A year ago, I had no dragons.

151
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,243
You have two days to decide.

152
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:01,920
Show me your cunt. I want to see
if it's worth fighting for.

153
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,828
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

154
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:13,104
Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.

155
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,924
Only a flagon?

156
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,096
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

157
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:19,559
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

158
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:23,368
The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

159
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,074
In the Second Sons, we share everything.

160
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,782
After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.

161
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:38,632
I'll come looking for you when this is over.

162
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,422
Ser Barristan,

163
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,393
if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

164
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,562
Gladly, Your Grace.

165
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,736
Half Robert, half lowborn.

166
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,625
Show the boy to his chambers.

167
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:51,925
Have the maids draw him a bath and
find him some decent clothes.

168
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,128
I'll come visit you soon.

169
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:04,785
What do you mean to do with him?

170
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,055
You know what I mean to do with him.

171
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,475
Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?

172
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,183
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

173
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:13,514
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

174
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:15,396
No.

175
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,485
If the lamb sees the knife,

176
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,670
she panics.

177
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,361
Her panic seeps into her meat,
darkens it, fouls the flavor.

178
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,427
You've slaughtered many lambs?

179
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,073
And none have seen the blade.

180
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,710
And tho... and thowg...

181
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:47,514
V... v... visenya...

182
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,516
Targaryen...

183
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:52,653
rod... rode

184
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:55,489
Vhagar...

185
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:57,724
Vhag...

186
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:00,262
Fuck me.

187
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,587
"Visenya Targaryen

188
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,301
rode Vhagar,

189
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:13,694
the smallest of the dragons,

190
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,207
though still...

191
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,197
large enog...

192
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:22,079
enough... enough

193
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:26,117
to swallow a horse whole. "

194
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,686
Your Grace.

195
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,134
They feeding you enough?

196
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,681
Two meals a day.

197
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,561
Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.

198
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:49,592
I cannot complain.

199
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,310
You don't belong in a place like this.

200
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,446
Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

201
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:57,648
Yeah.

202
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:03,082
I'm sorry about your son.

203
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:06,907
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

204
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:09,353
Good lad. Loyal lad.

205
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,180
Melisandre's returned.

206
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,520
I didn't know she'd been gone.

207
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,540
Came back with a bastard boy.

208
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,796
Robert's bastard boy.

209
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:24,826
Why?

210
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,240
She says there's power in king's blood.

211
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,500
- She's going to kill him.
- Sacrifice him.

212
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,926
Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man,

213
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:38,057
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

214
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:39,830
The boy is your nephew.

215
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,980
What of it? We're at war.

216
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:45,269
Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut

217
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,479
Robert bedded one drunken night?

218
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,609
Because he has your blood in his veins.

219
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,737
So did Renly.

220
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:57,512
Renly wronged you.

221
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:00,286
Renly declared himself king when
the throne belonged to you.

222
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,458
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

223
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,533
This boy has done you no harm.
He's an innocent.

224
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:08,118
How many boys live in Westeros?

225
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,737
How many girls? How many men? How many women?

226
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,367
The darkness will devour them all, she says.

227
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,158
The night that never ends.

228
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,223
Unless I triumph.

229
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,002
I never asked for this.

230
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:21,038
No more than I asked to be king.

231
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:23,806
We do not choose our destiny,

232
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,182
but we must do our duty, no?

233
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:29,648
Great or small, we must do our duty.

234
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:34,618
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

235
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:39,152
Your Grace,

236
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,872
why did you come to see me today?

237
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,797
I came to free you.

238
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:48,290
If you swear never to raise your
hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

239
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:50,830
I swear it.

240
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:54,237
I can't swear never to speak against her.

241
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,298
You have little regard for your own life.

242
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:57,915
Quite little, Your Grace.

243
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,810
Verging on none.

244
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,711
You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

245
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:08,343
but you came to me now before
this boy is put to the knife, because...

246
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:11,393
you knew I'd counsel restraint.

247
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:15,872
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

248
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:17,964
You're not a man who slaughters innocents

249
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,892
for gain or glory.

250
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:27,414
When my son was five he said to me,

251
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,584
"I don't ever want to die. "

252
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:32,962
I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child.
You won't ever. "

253
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:38,079
I hated the idea of him lying
awake in the dark, afraid.

254
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,798
I think mothers and fathers made up the gods

255
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:46,787
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

256
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,154
I saw a vision in the flames.

257
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,706
A great battle in the snow.

258
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:57,966
I saw it.

259
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,942
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

260
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,276
I never believed, but...

261
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:07,935
when you see the truth,

262
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:10,622
when it's right there in front of you

263
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,057
as real as these iron bars,

264
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:16,106
how can you deny her god is real?

265
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,887
Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.

266
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,620
You talk too much.

267
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,213
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

268
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:48,055
8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock.

269
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,774
My cock will find a way.

270
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:50,830
Tell him.

271
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,107
Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

272
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,456
She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

273
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,849
...the whore who doesn't like whores.

274
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,858
I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them.

275
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,541
And I'm no whore, my friend.

276
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,322
She sells her sheath

277
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,354
and you sell your blade.
What's the difference?

278
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:09,906
I fight for beauty.

279
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:11,026
For beauty?

280
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,687
We fight for gold.

281
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,511
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die.

282
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,987
The thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

283
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,952
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

284
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:25,038
You'll die young.

285
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:26,771
What do we do about the dragon girl?

286
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,358
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.

287
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:30,985
There won't be a battle.

288
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,780
And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.
We only have to deal with her.

289
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,826
She's well guarded.

290
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,454
Tonight's a new moon.

291
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:37,898
One of us slips into her camp,

292
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,778
past her Unsullied and her knights.

293
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:42,725
Which one of us?

294
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,130
Close your eyes, love.

295
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,216
Three coins.

296
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,688
A coin from Meereen,

297
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,898
a coin from Volantis,

298
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:00,818
and a coin from Braavos.

299
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,148
The Braavosi does the deed.

300
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,002
One for each of us, darling.

301
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,408
No peeking.

302
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,566
Do you hear me?

303
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,063
Follow my voice.

304
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,889
I'm right here.

305
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:36,616
You have something for me?

306
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,683
Valar morghulis.

307
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,291
Lady Sansa.

308
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,131
You look very handsome, my lord.

309
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,477
Oh, yes.

310
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,748
The husband of your dreams.

311
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,764
But you do look glorious.

312
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:24,103
Perhaps we could have a moment alone.

313
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,209
Do you mind?

314
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,418
...could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?

315
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,589
My lady,

316
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:49,768
I want you to know

317
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,265
I didn't ask for this.

318
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,446
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

319
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:56,676
No, don't.

320
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,656
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

321
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:04,086
You won't be a prisoner after today.
You'll be my wife.

322
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,956
I suppose that's a different kind of prison.

323
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,695
I just wanted to say...

324
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:13,502
I...

325
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:14,369
I'm just...

326
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,726
trying to say very badly...

327
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,229
I just...

328
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:22,910
just want to say I know how you feel.

329
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I doubt that very much, my lord.

330
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:31,927
You're right.

331
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,970
I have no idea how you feel.

332
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,300
And you have no idea how I feel.

333
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:46,093
But I promise you one thing, my lady.

334
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,831
I won't ever hurt you.

335
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,538
Do you drink wine?

336
00:21:57,744 --> 00:21:59,244
When I have to.

337
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:00,769
Well...

338
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,939
today you have to.

339
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:12,531
You look radiant, Your Grace.

340
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,687
Radiant? Why radiant?

341
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:17,773
It's the word that came to mind.

342
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,484
We're going to be sisters soon.

343
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,221
We should be friends.

344
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,740
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

345
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,270
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

346
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:31,117
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

347
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:34,289
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

348
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,319
Of course. They play it so often here at court.

349
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,563
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

350
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,815
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

351
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,512
House Reyne was a powerful family.

352
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,632
Very wealthy.

353
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:49,580
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

354
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,088
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

355
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:55,727
Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop

356
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:58,672
on the second highest rung.

357
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:01,407
If only you could take that final step,

358
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:04,287
you'd see further than all the rest.

359
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:08,083
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

360
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:10,267
So Lord Reyne built a castle

361
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,828
as grand as Casterly Rock.

362
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,617
He gave his wife diamonds

363
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:16,546
larger than any my mother ever wore.

364
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,351
And finally one day,

365
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:20,703
he rebelled against my father.

366
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,016
Do you know where House Reyne is now?

367
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:25,228
Gone.

368
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:27,360
Gone.

369
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,683
A gentle word.

370
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,002
Why not say slaughtered?

371
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:34,874
Every man, woman, and child

372
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,202
put to the sword.

373
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,445
I remember seeing their bodies hanging
high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

374
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:45,423
My father let them rot up there all summer.

375
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,384
It was a long summer.

376
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:51,335
"And now the rains weep o'er their halls,

377
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:54,171
and not a soul to hear. "

378
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:03,668
If you ever call me sister again,
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

379
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:36,093
What are you doing?

380
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,023
Your father's gone.

381
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,877
As the father of the realm,

382
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:45,128
it is my duty to give you away to your husband.

383
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:12,677
You may now cloak the bride
and bring her under your protection.

384
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,738
Could you...

385
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:51,738
Thank you.

386
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:00,017
Your Grace,

387
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:02,146
my lords, my ladies,

388
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,893
we stand here in the sight of gods and men

389
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,973
to witness the union of man and wife.

390
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,982
One flesh, one heart,

391
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,588
one soul,

392
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,726
now and forever.

393
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:35,158
Have you ever seen one like it?

394
00:27:35,974 --> 00:27:38,532
I've never seen anything like any of this.

395
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:39,895
Not in my life.

396
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,832
It's shocking, isn't it,

397
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,553
the first time you encounter real wealth?

398
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:47,867
When I was your age, I lived
on one bowl of stew a day.

399
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:50,897
And stew is a kind word for it.

400
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,149
In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown.

401
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:59,782
We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.

402
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,891
We knew it wasn't chicken.

403
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:15,148
Here, taste this.

404
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:19,574
You think I'm trying to poison you?

405
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:42,942
That's good.

406
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,936
That's really good.

407
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,091
Where do you think it's from?

408
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,522
- I couldn't even guess.
- Doesn't matter, does it?

409
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:56,679
It's the real thing or it's not.

410
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:59,709
You only need a tongue to tell the difference.

411
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,634
Go on, have some more.

412
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,344
You still don't trust it.

413
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:13,089
You think this is all a mistake
and that you'll have to pay

414
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,963
somehow for every bite you take.

415
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:18,093
That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.

416
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:21,228
There are no mistakes.

417
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:23,283
Not for us.

418
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,454
I'm a mistake.

419
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,187
I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother

420
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,959
instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.

421
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:35,122
Your father chose your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

422
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:38,161
He willed it so you could be here right now

423
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:42,152
with a power inside you
you can't even begin to understand.

424
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:48,526
And He brought me here to draw it from you

425
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:50,141
and birth it into the world.

426
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:55,441
We're both a part of His plan.

427
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:58,055
He wants this for us.

428
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,471
No, He demands this of us.

429
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,139
I don't understand. This...

430
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,776
this doesn't seem very religious.

431
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,096
According to whom?

432
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:15,099
The Silent Sisters?

433
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,218
With their stern looks,

434
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,083
muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?

435
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:23,936
What have their gods done for you?

436
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,275
When you pray to them,
what's their answer?

437
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:32,829
A god is real or he's not.

438
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:36,327
You only need eyes to see.

439
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:44,502
Death is coming for everyone and everything.

440
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:47,366
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.

441
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:50,524
And we can stop it...

442
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:52,376
you and I.

443
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:22,011
Let me show you what you have inside you.

444
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:24,894
Come fight death with me.

445
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:55,715
What are you doing?

446
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,867
You have to trust me.

447
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:25,771
What?

448
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,313
Get it away.

449
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,139
Get it off me.

450
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,169
Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.

451
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:35,755
Why are you doing this?

452
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:39,647
I told you there's power in the blood of kings.

453
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,918
And you have so much blood.

454
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:43,153
No.

455
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:45,088
No, no, no, no!

456
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:48,407
Not there. Not there!

457
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:56,437
You can blame Ser Davos.

458
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,976
He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.

459
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:03,070
He wanted a demonstration.

460
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:05,057
Please.

461
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:07,087
Please, Your Grace.

462
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:08,301
My lord!

463
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:46,995
The usurper Robb Stark.

464
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:52,968
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

465
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,664
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

466
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:21,449
So their son will be your nephew.

467
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,818
After you're wed to Cersei, of course.

468
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:28,876
And you will be the king's stepfather

469
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:30,562
and brother-in-law.

470
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,208
When you marry the king,

471
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,738
Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law

472
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:40,866
and your son will be Loras' nephew?

473
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,060
Grandson? I'm not sure.

474
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:47,300
But your brother will become your father-in-law.

475
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,466
That much is beyond dispute.

476
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:12,497
Will you pardon me, my lord?

477
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:15,893
Of course. Of course. Enjoy.

478
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:23,986
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

479
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,394
I've got a lifetime for that.

480
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:41,734
Stay.

481
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:52,408
You seem rather drunk.

482
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,907
Rather less than I plan to be.

483
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,814
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

484
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,530
This isn't about your wedding.

485
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,397
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

486
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:06,936
Your wife needs a child,
a Lannister child,

487
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:08,416
as soon as possible.

488
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:12,479
- And? - If you're going to give her one,
you need to perform.

489
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:15,598
What did you once call me?

490
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,994
A drunken little lust-filled beast.

491
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:21,041
- More than once.
- There you have it.

492
00:36:21,071 --> 00:36:22,682
Nothing to worry about.

493
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:25,566
Drinking and lust,

494
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:28,078
no man can match me in these things.

495
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:30,917
I am the god of tits and wine.

496
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,846
I shall build a shrine to myself

497
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,946
at the next brothel I visit.

498
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:40,560
You can drink, you can joke,

499
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,711
you can engage in juvenile attempts
to make your father uncomfortable,

500
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:47,291
but you will do your duty.

501
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:28,097
Well...

502
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:35,052
My father once told me...

503
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:36,782
Nobody cares what your father once told you.

504
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:03,028
- Congratulations, my lady.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

505
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:05,795
Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister.

506
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,188
Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.

507
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,675
It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?

508
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,759
What a glorious day.

509
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,205
Yes, Your Grace.

510
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,713
I suppose it doesn't really matter

511
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:19,638
which Lannister puts the baby into you.

512
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:24,309
Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight
after my uncle passes out.

513
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,775
How'd you like that?

514
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:30,422
You wouldn't?

515
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:34,634
That's all right. Ser Meryn and
Ser Boros will hold you down.

516
00:38:38,574 --> 00:38:41,331
Time for the bedding ceremony.

517
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,250
There will be no bedding ceremony.

518
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,081
Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?

519
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:47,616
Come, everyone.

520
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:50,317
Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.

521
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:53,822
Get rid of her gown.
She won't be needing it any longer.

522
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:56,630
Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.

523
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,590
There will be no bedding ceremony.

524
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,731
There will be if I command it.

525
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:06,470
Then you'll be fucking your own bride

526
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:09,313
with a wooden cock.

527
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,167
What did you say?

528
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,392
What did you...

529
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,480
say?!

530
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,776
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

531
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:29,993
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the king.

532
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:39,766
A bad joke, Your Grace.

533
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:43,730
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.

534
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:47,727
Mine is so small.

535
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,703
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

536
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:53,783
Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.

537
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,108
I am.

538
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:57,999
Guilty.

539
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:00,637
But...

540
00:40:03,254 --> 00:40:05,294
but it is my wedding night.

541
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:09,499
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

542
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:13,682
Come, wife.

543
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:21,115
I vomited on a girl once
in the middle of the act.

544
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:22,590
Not proud of it.

545
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,882
But I think honesty is important

546
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,452
between a man and wife, don't you agree?

547
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:33,097
Come, I'll tell you all about it.
Put you in the mood.

548
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:07,225
Is that wise, my lord?

549
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:08,935
Tyrion, Sansa.

550
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,025
My name is Tyrion.

551
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:14,751
Is that wise, Tyrion?

552
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:22,372
Nothing was ever wiser.

553
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:36,785
Astoundingly long.

554
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:39,035
What?

555
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:40,164
Neck.

556
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:42,025
You have one.

557
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,162
How old are you exactly?

558
00:41:47,192 --> 00:41:48,470
14.

559
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:54,211
Well...

560
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:57,611
talk won't make you any older.

561
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:08,184
My lord father has commanded me

562
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:10,787
to consummate this marriage.

563
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:29,956
Stop.

564
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:34,195
I can't.

565
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,400
I could, I won't.

566
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,575
But your father...

567
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:44,255
If my father wants someone to get fucked,

568
00:43:44,285 --> 00:43:46,204
I know where he can start.

569
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:53,614
I won't share your bed.

570
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:59,236
Not until you want me to.

571
00:44:01,828 --> 00:44:04,336
What if I never want you to?

572
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,750
And so my watch begins.

573
00:45:11,905 --> 00:45:13,338
19?

574
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:14,640
Yes, Your Grace.

575
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:17,609
How can anyone speak 19 languages?

576
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:20,984
It only took Your Grace a year to
learn Dothraki reasonably well.

577
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:23,288
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki

578
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:26,285
or grunt at my husband and hope...

579
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:30,184
what do you mean reasonably well?

580
00:45:31,454 --> 00:45:34,261
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.

581
00:45:34,822 --> 00:45:36,401
So guttural and harsh.

582
00:45:48,374 --> 00:45:50,477
Athjahaka.

583
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:52,912
Ath-ja-hakar.

584
00:45:53,578 --> 00:45:55,614
Athjahakar.

585
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,935
Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

586
00:46:00,851 --> 00:46:03,722
Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.

587
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,304
The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.

588
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:10,112
It is the only proper language for poetry.

589
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:18,245
No screaming or she dies.

590
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,318
What do you want?

591
00:46:35,196 --> 00:46:36,196
You.

592
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,857
Let her go.

593
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:39,835
Don't scream, lovely girl.

594
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,790
You were sent here to kill me?

595
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:52,851
So why haven't you?

596
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:54,799
I don't want to.

597
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:57,934
What do your captains have to say about that?

598
00:46:57,964 --> 00:46:59,710
You should ask them.

599
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:07,038
Why?

600
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:09,284
We had philosophical differences.

601
00:47:09,314 --> 00:47:10,414
Over what?

602
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:12,324
Your beauty.

603
00:47:12,524 --> 00:47:15,142
It meant more to me than it did to them.

604
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:16,268
You're a strange man.

605
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:18,886
I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.

606
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,381
I only do what I want to do.

607
00:47:20,411 --> 00:47:23,222
And this is supposed to impress me?

608
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:24,252
Yes.

609
00:47:26,435 --> 00:47:29,476
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?

610
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:31,556
They ordered me to murder you.

611
00:47:31,737 --> 00:47:33,904
I told them I preferred not to.

612
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,234
They told me I had no choice.

613
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:38,128
I told them I am Daario Naharis.

614
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:40,751
I always have a choice.

615
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,354
They drew their swords

616
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:47,127
and I drew mine.

617
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:19,952
Will you fight for me?

618
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,575
Swear to me.

619
00:48:32,265 --> 00:48:35,565
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

620
00:48:35,944 --> 00:48:38,444
My sword is yours, my life is yours,

621
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:40,293
my heart is yours.

622
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:01,266
You really ought to knock.

623
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:03,146
I brought your breakfast.

624
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,935
It's getting dark.

625
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:25,858
We could stay here for the night.

626
00:50:58,652 --> 00:51:01,613
How hard can it be to build a fire?

627
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:02,843
It doesn't matter.

628
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:06,441
Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.

629
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:27,796
He winked at me before.

630
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:29,787
I doubt it.

631
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:32,457
I saw him wink at me.

632
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:34,537
He blinked.

633
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:40,102
I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference
between a wink and a blink.

634
00:51:40,837 --> 00:51:41,837
A what?

635
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:45,869
Well, I mean,

636
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:48,365
there's no real difference.

637
00:51:50,794 --> 00:51:52,894
A wink is on purpose.

638
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:58,173
You thought of a name yet?

639
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,609
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

640
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:07,867
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

641
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:08,897
What?

642
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:10,482
No.

643
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:13,247
This is just the way I talk.

644
00:52:16,538 --> 00:52:18,341
I'll build that fire.

645
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:29,423
Don't you think he should have a name?

646
00:52:30,986 --> 00:52:33,136
I don't know many boys' names.

647
00:52:34,372 --> 00:52:35,883
Let's see,

648
00:52:36,634 --> 00:52:37,634
there's Duncan,

649
00:52:38,484 --> 00:52:39,641
Kevan, Jon...

650
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:42,476
Guymon,

651
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:43,529
Feldan,

652
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:44,767
Tristifer.

653
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,828
Craster.

654
00:52:47,688 --> 00:52:49,338
Uh, yes.

655
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:52,091
Maybe that's not...

656
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:53,126
Mormont.

657
00:52:54,487 --> 00:52:56,187
That's a lovely idea,

658
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,420
but Mormont's a last name.

659
00:52:59,396 --> 00:53:01,296
Why is it a last name?

660
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:04,342
Well, it's a family name.

661
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:08,837
For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.

662
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:11,005
Samwell is my birth name

663
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,400
and Tarly...

664
00:53:12,802 --> 00:53:14,202
is my family name.

665
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,542
You see?

666
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:18,968
My father is also a Tarly.

667
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,702
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

668
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,732
No.

669
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:25,427
Randyll Tarly.

670
00:53:25,457 --> 00:53:27,106
Randyll is a handsome name.

671
00:53:29,214 --> 00:53:31,314
Please don't name him Randyll.

672
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,391
Is your father cruel like mine?

673
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:43,456
Different manner of cruel.

674
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,633
Not Randyll, then.

675
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:22,674
Don't.

676
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,589
Don't go out there.

677
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:26,681
I'll be back.

678
00:54:27,455 --> 00:54:29,405
I just want to look.

679
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:06,306
Go inside.

680
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,249
Go back inside.

681
00:55:09,279 --> 00:55:10,279
I'll...

682
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:25,497
It's come for the baby.

683
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,450
Stay back!

684
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,025
You stay back!

685
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:05,378
No, you can't have him!

686
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:06,408
No!

687
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,120
No!

688
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:49,874
