1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,474
<i>Our father has instructed us to tell you</i>

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,089
that his alliance with the North can continue

3
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,633
if his terms are met.

4
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:11,005
Lord Frey requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,890
It's hard to say which of the four of us
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

6
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:16,350
<i>Probably Sansa.</i>

7
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:20,604
Though Loras will certainly come to know
a deep and singular misery.

8
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:21,885
<i>Who's going to tell her?</i>

9
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,332
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just
trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.

10
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:28,695
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,073
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

12
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,243
as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.

13
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:36,033
And you will swear to tell your father that

14
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:38,204
I had nothing to do with your maiming.

15
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,484
- My lady.
- She won't be going with you.

16
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:51,802
So let's play a game.

17
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,596
Which body part do you need the least?

18
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,308
How many times has the Lord brought him back?

19
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,274
Six.

20
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:01,103
He sent you to us for a reason.

21
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:02,729
You have someone He needs.

22
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,297
You told me I could be one of you.

23
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:05,899
You told me this was a brotherhood.

24
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:08,026
You will make kings rise and fall.

25
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,706
- The visions take their toll.
- He's having one now?

26
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:13,126
I saw Jon Snow.

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,459
At Castle Black?

28
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,124
He was on the wrong side of the Wall,

29
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:18,082
surrounded by enemies.

33
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:39,995
How far are we?

34
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:41,795
About a week, I think.

35
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,949
You think? You don't know?

36
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:46,453
When we went to Castle Black,

37
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,537
we took the kingsroad.

38
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:50,610
You and your roads.

39
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:53,150
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

40
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,598
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

41
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,196
Most of the time, yes.

42
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,471
How do the men holding the banners fight?

43
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,349
They don't, really.

44
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,541
It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

45
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,691
And the drummers...

46
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,293
is that a great honor, too?

47
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:14,171
Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.

48
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:15,984
So what good are they?

49
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:17,758
They help the men march.

50
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,297
- How?
- Well, it's...

51
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:22,804
it's the rhythm.

52
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,139
Oh, you mean

53
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,044
right foot, left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot?

54
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,155
You need help remembering that?

55
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:34,215
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

56
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:37,615
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

57
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,652
No.

58
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:44,195
No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire
the North has ever seen

59
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,378
to let them know you're coming.

60
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,485
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

61
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,832
She's right, you don't.

62
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,234
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

63
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,002
Cut her loose, too.

64
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,228
Do you see her sulking about it?

65
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,079
That's because she understands
the way things are.

66
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,562
And are you gonna share it with me?

67
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:15,145
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

68
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,551
People work together when it suits them.

69
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,152
They're loyal when it suits them.

70
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,639
They love each other when it suits them.

71
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,983
And they kill each other when it suits them.

72
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,701
She knows that, you don't.

73
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:30,295
Which is why you'll never hold onto her.

74
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:48,338
That rain will cost us another day.

75
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,056
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

76
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,387
Lord Walder is prickly by nature.

77
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,450
Prickly? That what you call it?

78
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,977
Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.

79
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,654
- Yes, and that is why...
- I've seen wet shits

80
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:05,296
I liked better than Walder Frey.

81
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,423
Apologies, Your Grace.

82
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,670
Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.

83
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:16,510
I've spent the last two years
nursing wounded men,

84
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,461
watching them bleed and die.

85
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,547
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,053
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

87
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,844
He can take it as he likes.

88
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:30,040
He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.

89
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:32,058
It was a king he wanted.

90
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,994
Edmure is the best match a Frey has had

91
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:37,105
in the history of their house.

92
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,869
We should all get some sleep.

93
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:02,649
If you don't put some clothes on,
I can't promise I won't attack you again.

94
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,693
Attack. Attack.

95
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:28,673
Who are you writing?

96
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:30,432
My mother.

97
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:34,264
Is that Valyrian?

98
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:35,607
<i>Gaaa.</i>

99
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,049
<i>Gaaa?</i>

100
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,010
Say hello for me.

101
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:48,586
<i>Ritsas.</i>

102
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,947
<i>"Ritsas. "</i>

103
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,980
That was close enough.

104
00:08:57,473 --> 00:08:59,611
Does she know her daughter's a queen?

105
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:01,829
Not yet.

106
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,039
That will be a surprise, I expect.

107
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,234
Many surprises for her.

108
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,898
How am I supposed to sit here planning a war

109
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:20,342
when you're over there looking like that?

110
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,757
Will you come with me one day to Volantis?

111
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,039
When all this is over?

112
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,211
I will.

113
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,324
I promise.

114
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:41,588
I know she'd love to meet you.

115
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:44,648
And her grandchild.

116
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:50,836
What, now?

117
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:57,664
Are you certain?

118
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:01,734
Are you angry with me?

119
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:03,698
Angry?

120
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,233
You're my queen.

121
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:16,199
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

122
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,640
Maybe one of each.

123
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:21,461
Don't get greedy.

124
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,170
Can you leave the war for one night?

125
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:37,555
I love you.

126
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:40,912
Do you hear me?

127
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:43,986
I love you.

128
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,420
Most men fuck like dogs.

129
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,294
No grace, no skill.

130
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:08,848
A few dozen thrusts and done.

131
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:11,880
You need to be patient. Give her time.

132
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,248
Your cock shouldn't go near her

133
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,580
till she's slick as a baby seal.

134
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:18,797
And then...

135
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,723
you go inside, but slowly.

136
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,351
Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.

137
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,259
Come on!

138
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:29,938
Hey, come on.

139
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,702
You think he loves you, is that it?

140
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:46,313
What did he tell you?

141
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:49,823
He's gonna make you his lady
and live with you in some castle?

142
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,344
No, he didn't tell me anything.

143
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:54,449
He barely talks.

144
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,663
I've seen you two whispering in the night,

145
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:58,847
giggling like a pair of girls.

146
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,872
What, you're jealous?

147
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,499
Of course I'm jealous.

148
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,677
You should be with one of your own.

149
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,474
And you're one of my own?

150
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,710
I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.

151
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,824
You would if you were mine.

152
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:15,504
I'd tell you that you're beautiful

153
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,676
and fierce...

154
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,179
and wild.

155
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:21,910
I'd be good to you.

156
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:25,939
You love him?

157
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,745
'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?

158
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,020
You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?

159
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:43,638
- You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
- Don't touch me.

160
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:47,035
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

161
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:53,826
<i>Growing up at Winterfell,
all I ever wanted was to escape,</i>

162
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,456
to come here...

163
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:57,825
to the capital.

164
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:01,403
See the southern knights and their painted armor

165
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:03,825
and King's Landing after dark...

166
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:08,560
all the candles burning in all those windows.

167
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,874
I'm stupid.

168
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,730
A stupid little girl

169
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:18,198
with stupid dreams who never learns.

170
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:19,228
Come on.

171
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:24,295
Come walk with me.

172
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,314
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

173
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:32,617
I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.

174
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:36,669
I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa,
and so does my grandmother.

175
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,032
You would have been happy at Highgarden.

176
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,685
But women in our position
must make the best of our circumstances.

177
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:49,930
How do I make the best of my circumstances?

178
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,382
I have to marry him.

179
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,780
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?

180
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:57,275
No.

181
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:59,019
Has he been kind to you?

182
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,121
He's tried.

183
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:03,619
You don't want him, though.

184
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:04,949
He's a Lannister.

185
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,697
Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?

186
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:10,818
I'm sorry.

187
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,478
Here I am complaining to you...

188
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,834
My son will be king.

189
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,299
Sons learn from their mothers.
I plan to teach mine a great deal.

190
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:21,961
And your son...

191
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,065
if I'm not mistaken,

192
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,763
your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock

193
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,633
and the North someday.

194
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
What?

195
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,702
My son...

196
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:37,862
with him.

197
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:42,019
I'll have to...

198
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,985
we'll have to...

199
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:48,410
- If it's the pain you're worried about...
- I'm not afraid of the pain.

200
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,615
Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

201
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,406
What is it, then?

202
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,688
He's rather good-looking even with the scar.

203
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:59,697
Especially with the scar.

204
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,199
He's a dwarf.

205
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,881
And Loras...

206
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,433
Some women like tall men.

207
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:13,050
Some like short men.

208
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:16,130
Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

209
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,261
Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men,
pretty girls.

210
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,861
Most women don't know what they
like until they've tried it.

211
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:28,251
And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little

212
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,347
before we're old and gray.

213
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:33,705
Tyrion may surprise you.

214
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:36,430
From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.

215
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:39,473
And that's a...

216
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,997
good thing?
- It can be.

217
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:46,074
We're very complicated, you know.
Pleasing us takes practice.

218
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,648
How do you know all this?

219
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:51,255
Did your mother teach you?

220
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,174
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

221
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:04,139
<i>- She's a child.
- She's a foot taller than you.</i>

222
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:06,132
A tall child.

223
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:07,965
What's the youngest you've ever had?

224
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,124
Not that young.

225
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:10,925
How much older?

226
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Older.

227
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:16,676
You're a lord, she's a lady.

228
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:20,303
And a beauty at that.
I don't see the problem.

229
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,576
Shae isn't going to like it.

230
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,976
Shae is a whore.

231
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,266
Are you gonna marry her?

232
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:30,379
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

233
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,021
I should never have told you about that.

234
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:36,706
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

235
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:39,615
All you have to do
is get a son in the Stark girl.

236
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:43,878
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.
You can rule the North in his name.

237
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,709
You'll have two women and a
whole kingdom of your own.

238
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,786
Two women to despise me

239
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:51,012
and a whole kingdom to join them.

240
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,536
You waste time trying to get people to love you,

241
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:58,476
you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.

242
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,607
You want to fuck that Stark girl.

243
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:06,746
You just don't want to admit it.

244
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,714
I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.

245
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,752
The ones already there don't need company.

246
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,674
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

247
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:21,045
Evil notions come free.

248
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:55,137
Your Grace.

249
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,028
Grandfather.

250
00:17:58,393 --> 00:17:59,726
You wanted to speak to me?

251
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Yes.

252
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,891
I'd like a report on the
meetings of my small council.

253
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:10,217
You're welcome to attend the meetings
of your small council, Your Grace.

254
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:13,383
Any or all of them.
- I've been very busy.

255
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,452
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

256
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:17,482
Of course.

257
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:23,588
You've been holding the council meetings
in the Tower of the Hand

258
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,553
instead of the small council chamber.

259
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:26,894
I have, yes.

260
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,443
May I ask why?

261
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,859
The Tower of the Hand is where I work.

262
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:36,211
To walk from there to here would take time,

263
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,427
time I could otherwise spend productively.

264
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,897
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

265
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:45,147
I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

266
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,987
We could arrange to have you carried.

267
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:10,315
Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east...

268
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,189
and her dragons.

269
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,003
- Where did you hear about this?
- Is it true?

270
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,169
Apparently so.

271
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:24,163
Don't you think we
ought to do something about it?

272
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,313
When I was Hand of the King
under your father's predecessor,

273
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:33,125
the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons

274
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,100
were kept in this room.

275
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,076
The skull of the last of them

276
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,469
was right here.

277
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:43,828
It was the size of an apple.

278
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:48,456
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

279
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:53,345
Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged
died 300 years ago.

280
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:58,311
Curiosities on the far side of the world
are no threat to us.

281
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:01,890
But how do we know these
dragons are just curiosities

282
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,856
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

283
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:07,840
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

284
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,762
who serve the realm by counseling the king
on matters about which he knows nothing.

285
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:14,532
But I haven't been counseled.

286
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,475
You are being counseled at this very moment.

287
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:22,771
I should be consulted about such things.

288
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:26,972
From now on, I will see to it
that you are appropriately consulted

289
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,894
on important matters

290
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,209
whenever necessary.

291
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:38,963
Your Grace.

292
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:53,472
Yunkai.

293
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:55,257
The Yellow City.

294
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:03,470
The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.

295
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,783
We can defeat them.

296
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:07,268
On the field, with ease.

297
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,668
But they won't meet us on the field.

298
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,575
They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.

299
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,711
If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls

300
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,365
and chip away at us, man by man.

301
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:22,327
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

302
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:24,597
We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

303
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,217
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to

304
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:29,754
Westeros or the Iron Throne.

305
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,686
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

306
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:38,010
200,000, if not more.

307
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:43,049
Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.

308
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:27,128
Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz

309
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:29,726
of that ancient and honorable house,

310
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:32,331
master of men and speaker to savages,

311
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,731
to offer terms of peace.

312
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:40,418
Noble lord, you are in the presence
of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,

313
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,685
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

314
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,753
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

315
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:48,974
Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.

316
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:51,771
You may approach.

317
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:53,497
Sit.

318
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:05,041
Will the noble lord take refreshment?

319
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:19,184
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

320
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:24,611
Our empire was old
before dragons stirred in old Valyria.

321
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,146
Many an army has broken against our walls.

322
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,807
You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.

323
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,558
Good.

324
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:39,269
My Unsullied need practice.
I was told to blood them early.

325
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,672
If blood is your desire,

326
00:24:41,702 --> 00:24:43,289
blood shall flow.

327
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:46,179
But why?

328
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:49,362
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

329
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:53,028
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

330
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:59,910
The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift

331
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,208
for the silver queen.

332
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:10,547
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

333
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,780
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

334
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:16,852
As I said, we are a generous people.

335
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,442
You shall have as many ships as you require.

336
00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:21,172
And what do you ask in return?

337
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,501
All we ask...

338
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:25,811
is that you make use of these ships.

339
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,473
Sail them back to Westeros where you belong

340
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:31,283
and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.

341
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:36,774
I have a gift for you as well.

342
00:25:37,673 --> 00:25:38,673
Your life.

343
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:41,612
- My life?
- And the lives of your wise masters.

344
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,992
But I also want something in return.

345
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:47,926
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

346
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,114
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

347
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:55,025
clothing, and property as they
can carry as payment

348
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:56,785
for their years of servitude.

349
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,980
Reject this gift,

350
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:01,348
and I shall show you no mercy.

351
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:02,979
You are mad.

352
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:05,799
We are not Astapor or Qarth.

353
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,608
We are Yunkai...

354
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:11,834
and we have powerful friends. Friends who would
take great pleasure in destroying you.

355
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,591
Those who survive, we shall enslave once more.

356
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,701
Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

357
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:23,805
You swore me safe conduct.
- I did.

358
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,553
But my dragons made no promises.

359
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:28,962
And you threatened their mother.

360
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:31,526
Take the gold.

361
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,011
My gold.

362
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,973
You gave it to me, remember?

363
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,654
And I shall put it to good use.

364
00:26:45,684 --> 00:26:48,875
You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you.

365
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,005
Now get out.

366
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,241
The Yunkish are a proud people.

367
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,539
They will not bend.

368
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:01,745
And what happens to things that don't bend?

369
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,495
He said he had powerful friends.

370
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:04,905
Who was he talking about?

371
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:07,432
I don't know.

372
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:09,591
Find out.

373
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:26,293
Chains?

374
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,923
Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.

375
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,829
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

376
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,237
Golden chains.

377
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:38,801
You could buy a ship with these.

378
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:41,078
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

379
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:44,608
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

380
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:48,625
So, am I invited to your wedding?

381
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:53,141
I didn't ask for this marriage.

382
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:55,203
- I didn't want it.
- No?

383
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,037
She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.

384
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,567
That doesn't mean that...

385
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,757
this is duty, not desire.

386
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,951
Is that what you will tell
yourself when you fuck her?

387
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,188
I don't have a choice. My father...

388
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,172
Does not rule the world.

389
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,570
We can still go across the Narrow Sea.

390
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,180
What would I do there?

391
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:18,698
Juggle?

392
00:28:19,513 --> 00:28:21,939
I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

393
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:24,730
And I'm Shae the funny whore.

394
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,132
My feelings for you have not changed.

395
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:32,331
I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.

396
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,247
While I empty her chamber pot

397
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:36,291
and lick your cock when you're bored?

398
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:38,645
I swear to you it will not be like that.

399
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:39,893
No?

400
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,173
What will it be like?

401
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:44,981
I will buy you a good home

402
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:46,709
somewhere in the city.

403
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:48,953
You will have fine clothes,

404
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:51,813
guards to keep you safe, servants.

405
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:56,207
Any children we might have

406
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:58,427
will be well provided for.

407
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:02,397
Children? You think I want children
who can never see their father?

408
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:06,208
Who would be killed in their sleep
if their grandfather found out about them?

409
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:07,681
Listen.

410
00:29:08,598 --> 00:29:10,098
Listen to me, my lady.

411
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:13,085
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

412
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,021
You'll always be my lady.

413
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:21,682
I'm your whore.

414
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,134
And when you are tired of fucking me,

415
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,342
I will be nothing.

416
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,301
What happened?

417
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,570
Wildfire.

418
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,819
I should have been here.

419
00:30:06,427 --> 00:30:10,377
After all the running and fighting,
here I am, back where I started.

420
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:11,855
Do you miss it?

421
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,192
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

422
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:18,371
Never had a father. Never wanted one.

423
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,747
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

424
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,220
Your talent for fighting?

425
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,780
I'm lowborn.

426
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,788
As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.

427
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,448
Mine was a slave.

428
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:30,947
So was I.

429
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,318
Bought and sold,

430
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,454
scourged and branded,

431
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:38,172
until the Lord of Light reached down,

432
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:40,232
took me in his hand and raised me up.

433
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,195
I was born in Flea Bottom.

434
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:46,106
Your blood is noble.

435
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:48,995
Are you saying...

436
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:52,182
my father, he was some lord or...

437
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:54,126
There.

438
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:56,395
Your father's house.

439
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,393
I'm just a bastard.

440
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:10,022
The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon,

441
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:13,977
First of His Name, King of the Andals
and the First Men.

442
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:17,834
Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you?

443
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:21,927
There is power in a king's blood.

444
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,357
Come sit by the fire, child.

445
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:46,424
Not talking, eh?
That's a first.

446
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:49,216
I don't talk to traitors.

447
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:53,517
I didn't like giving up the boy.

448
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:54,627
But you did.

449
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,629
You took the gold and you gave him up.

450
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:01,772
The Red God is the one true god.

451
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,493
You've seen his power.

452
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:07,306
When he commands, we obey.

453
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:10,689
He's not my one true god.

454
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:12,534
No?

455
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,161
Who's yours?

456
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:18,331
Death.

457
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:32,181
Spotted a Lannister raiding party.

458
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:34,219
- How many?
- No more than 20.

459
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,144
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

460
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:42,514
What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?

461
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,986
Yeah!

462
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:47,305
But what about Riverrun?

463
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,476
It's not south. It's west of here.

464
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:51,771
It will still be west of here two days from now.

465
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:54,936
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

466
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,759
But we need to do this first.
- Why?

467
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:59,384
So you can steal their gold?

468
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,717
I swear to you, this isn't...

469
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,315
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

470
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:05,084
You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.

471
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:08,270
You'll lie to anyone. I hope
the Lannisters kill you all.

472
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,709
One day you'll understand, but now...

473
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,673
<i>- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!</i>

474
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,749
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

475
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:45,566
Won't do you no good.

476
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,960
I thought you were gone.

477
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:06,316
Tomorrow.

478
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:13,248
Have they told you what they plan to do with me?

479
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:17,635
Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.

480
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:21,372
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

481
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,152
You're to remain here.

482
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:25,724
With Locke?

483
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,388
I owe you a debt.

484
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:41,055
When Catelyn Stark released you,

485
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:43,065
we both made a promise to her.

486
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,467
Now it's your promise.

487
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:48,071
You gave your word.

488
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:49,979
Keep it

489
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:51,948
and consider the debt paid.

490
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:57,004
I will return the Stark girls to their mother.

491
00:34:58,779 --> 00:34:59,779
I swear it.

492
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,520
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

493
00:35:27,744 --> 00:35:28,744
Here.

494
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:30,389
Let me.

495
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:39,955
It will take time.

496
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:49,310
Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel
to give him back his chain.

497
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,490
My father will make him Grand Maester
if he grows me a new hand.

498
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,675
You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?

499
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:03,199
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

500
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,429
The Lannisters send their regards.

501
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,819
Safe journey, Kingslayer.

502
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,759
Nothing to say?

503
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:18,044
I liked you better before.

504
00:36:18,162 --> 00:36:21,062
I don't remember chopping your balls off, too.

505
00:36:21,756 --> 00:36:24,279
And don't you worry about your friend.

506
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,816
We'll take good care of her.

507
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,892
Gentle, my lord.

508
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:14,796
Gentle.

509
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,828
Myranda knows what she's doing.

510
00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:31,174
Let her.

511
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:34,922
She trained as a septa, only...

512
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:38,641
she had other urges.

513
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:40,590
So did the septons,

514
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,070
only they lied about it.

515
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:45,065
Where is he?

516
00:37:45,551 --> 00:37:46,901
Who, my lord?

517
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,140
There's no one here but you,

518
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,720
me, and Violet.

519
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:53,096
Please.

520
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,592
Don't you want us to see it?

521
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,537
Oh, come on. Let us see it.

522
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,906
Everybody talks about it.

523
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,192
He sent you.

524
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Who sent us?

525
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,571
We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.

526
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,051
We heard so much about it.

527
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:11,818
Please.

528
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:14,425
There it is.

529
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:20,882
Do you think we're ugly?

530
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:23,617
He thinks we're ugly.

531
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,885
Well, he's been through so much.

532
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,053
Look at his poor face.

533
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,094
Help me.

534
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,188
If he comes back...

535
00:38:37,096 --> 00:38:39,923
We need to make him feel better.

536
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:42,288
And how can we make him feel better?

537
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:44,503
I have an idea.

538
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,061
She's shy.

539
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,402
You know how they are, these...

540
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:12,506
religious girls.

541
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:17,049
Maybe he doesn't know how we are.

542
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:31,925
I felt something.

543
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,804
As good as they say?

544
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,991
And why should you get all the fun?

545
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,302
What?

546
00:40:07,182 --> 00:40:08,882
You like her better?

547
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,710
Plenty there for both of us.

548
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:18,507
I was here first.

549
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:27,298
I'm sorry.

550
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:28,612
I'm sorry.

551
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,680
Terrible timing.

552
00:40:34,694 --> 00:40:36,844
But I was getting jealous.

553
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:42,459
Well?

554
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:46,711
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

555
00:40:58,442 --> 00:41:01,142
Everyone knows you love girls.

556
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:05,540
I bet you always thought they loved you back.

557
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,717
Your famous cock must be very precious to you.

558
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:21,797
Would you say it's your most precious part?

559
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,309
Please.

560
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,343
No.

561
00:41:31,373 --> 00:41:33,450
No! Mercy, please!

562
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,395
Please, mercy! Mercy!

563
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,572
This is mercy.

564
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:40,364
I'm not killing you.

565
00:41:40,954 --> 00:41:42,746
Just making a few...

566
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:44,316
alterations.

567
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:48,349
No! No!

568
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:50,416
No! Please, no!

569
00:41:50,446 --> 00:41:51,888
No! No!

570
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,283
No, please! Please!

571
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:58,794
You're gonna scare it off.

572
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:00,724
I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.

573
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:04,767
It's too far away.

574
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:29,704
Is that a palace?

575
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:34,074
It's a windmill.

576
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:36,465
Windmill.

577
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:39,389
Who built it?

578
00:42:39,419 --> 00:42:40,419
Some king?

579
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:43,383
Just the men who used to live here.

580
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:46,911
They must have been great builders,
stacking stones so high.

581
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,931
Winterfell has towers three times that size.

582
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:52,461
"I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell.

583
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:57,345
My daddy was a fancy lord
and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds. "

584
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:02,486
If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be
swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.

585
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:04,432
What's swooning?

586
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:05,462
Fainting.

587
00:43:06,427 --> 00:43:08,127
What's fainting?

588
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:13,533
When a girl sees blood and collapses.

589
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:17,368
- Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
- Well...

590
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:20,779
not all girls are like you.

591
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,483
Well, girls see more blood than boys.

592
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:28,225
Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?

593
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,945
Oh, a spider!

594
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,699
Save me, Jon Snow.

595
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:36,736
My dress is made of the purest silk
from Tralalalaleeday.

596
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:40,255
I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

597
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,278
Would you?

598
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,045
So I could tear it off you.

599
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,517
Well, you rip my pretty silk dress,

600
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,297
I'll blacken your eye.

601
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:04,432
Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.

602
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,100
Or maybe one day I'll take you there.

603
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:11,066
After we've taken our land back.

604
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:19,726
You won't win.

605
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,370
I know your people are brave, no one denies that.

606
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,349
- You know nothing...
- Six times...

607
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:30,157
in the last thousand years,
a King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the kingdoms.

608
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:31,999
Six times they failed.

609
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:33,379
And how do you know that?

610
00:44:33,466 --> 00:44:35,366
Every boy in the North knows it.

611
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:37,221
We grow up learning it.

612
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:40,038
Where the battles were fought,
the names of the heroes, who died where.

613
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:41,368
Six times...

614
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:43,692
you've invaded and six times...

615
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,417
you've failed.

616
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,410
The seventh will be the same.

617
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,713
Mance is different.

618
00:44:48,743 --> 00:44:50,443
You don't have the discipline.

619
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:54,259
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

620
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:56,596
You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.

621
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:57,626
I do.

622
00:44:58,818 --> 00:45:00,118
I know it.

623
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:02,510
If you attack the Wall, you'll die.

624
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,690
All of you.

625
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:14,003
All of us.

626
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,590
You're mine

627
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,800
as I'm yours.

628
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:37,382
And if we die, we die.

629
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:40,376
But first we'll live.

630
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:42,118
Yes.

631
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,533
First we'll live.

632
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:03,242
What's he going on about?

633
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:06,799
And how come he always gets to sit and chat

634
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:08,629
while we do all the work?

635
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:18,089
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

636
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,261
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

637
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,168
You think I can't hear you every day?
Filling his head with black magic.

638
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,841
Talking about visions and
three-eyed ravens and worse.

639
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,142
Leave him alone.

640
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:29,810
He can speak for himself.

641
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,694
I don't fill his head with anything.

642
00:46:31,724 --> 00:46:33,474
So what do you talk about?

643
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:36,182
What's happening to him and...

644
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,412
what that means.
- Go on, then.

645
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:39,905
Tell us what it means.

646
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,535
It's not like that.

647
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:45,329
I wish I could tell him all the answers.
It would be much easier.

648
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:50,079
I don't want you talking to him anymore.
Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.

649
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:53,305
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

650
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:54,836
I told you already.

651
00:46:54,866 --> 00:46:56,566
Jon Snow isn't there.

652
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:58,425
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.

653
00:46:58,455 --> 00:46:59,917
Oh, no. I'm not going back there.

654
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:03,256
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

655
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:06,275
Look at me.

656
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,335
The raven's been coming to me
ever since I fell from that tower.

657
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:14,257
He wants me to find him.

658
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,828
I don't have my legs anymore.

659
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:22,202
This is what I have now.
- You have a family.

660
00:47:22,825 --> 00:47:27,308
You need to go back to Castle Black
so you can get back to them where you belong.

661
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:29,371
What if I belong in the North?

662
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:31,432
What if...

663
00:47:32,247 --> 00:47:34,855
I fell from that tower for a reason?

664
00:47:35,218 --> 00:47:37,047
Is that what he's telling you?

665
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:39,297
That it's all for a reason?

666
00:47:39,327 --> 00:47:43,523
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

667
00:47:43,956 --> 00:47:45,538
I wish it were true, little lord.

668
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:49,651
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

669
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:52,482
- You don't understand. You don't know.
- You don't know.

670
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:56,026
None of you know.
None of you have been up there.

671
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:01,008
I had a man once.

672
00:48:01,564 --> 00:48:02,878
A good man.

673
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:04,891
Bruni, his name was.

674
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,922
I was his and he was mine.

675
00:48:08,391 --> 00:48:10,870
But one night Bruni disappears.

676
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:13,573
People said he left me,

677
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,363
but I knew him.

678
00:48:15,397 --> 00:48:17,786
He'd never leave me.

679
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:19,337
Not for long.

680
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:21,736
I knew he'd come back.

681
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:24,883
And he did.

682
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:29,190
He came in through the back of the hut.

683
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:32,605
Only it wasn't Bruni.

684
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:33,831
Not really.

685
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:38,625
His skin was pale

686
00:48:38,768 --> 00:48:40,960
like a dead man's.

687
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,194
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

688
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,093
He came at me,

689
00:48:50,373 --> 00:48:52,307
grabbed me by the neck

690
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:55,374
and squeezed so hard

691
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:58,588
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

692
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:02,977
I don't know how I got the knife.

693
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:04,546
When I did,

694
00:49:04,576 --> 00:49:08,080
I stuck it deep into his heart.

695
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,493
And he hardly seemed to notice.

696
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,133
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

697
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,239
I didn't ask the gods what it meant.

698
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:28,262
I didn't need to. I already knew.

699
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,468
It meant the North was no place for men to be.

700
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:33,860
Not anymore.

701
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:41,397
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.

702
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:52,230
How is the pain, my lord?

703
00:49:54,973 --> 00:49:58,335
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

704
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:04,784
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

705
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:07,514
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

706
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:09,519
You're a learned man.

707
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:11,101
All the good it's done me.

708
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:13,654
You did well sewing up this mess.

709
00:50:14,027 --> 00:50:17,951
You're far better at this sort of work
than Grand Maester Pycelle.

710
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:21,048
Faint praise, my lord.

711
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,618
So why did the Citadel take your chain?

712
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,085
Did you fondle one boy too many?

713
00:50:28,115 --> 00:50:30,653
No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

714
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,224
What is?

715
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,677
Curiosity.

716
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,398
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

717
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:46,690
And the only way to understand it
is to study the afflicted.

718
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:50,076
You performed experiments on living men.

719
00:50:50,106 --> 00:50:52,272
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

720
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,461
My studies have given me insight

721
00:50:55,826 --> 00:50:59,228
that has saved many lives.
- Dying paupers, I assume.

722
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,417
Men with no families to complain.

723
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:07,099
You found them moaning in the poorhouse
and had them carted back to your garret

724
00:51:07,561 --> 00:51:10,669
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

725
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,853
How many men have you killed, my lord?

726
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:16,126
- I don't know.
- 50?

727
00:51:16,545 --> 00:51:17,937
100?

728
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:21,084
Countless.

729
00:51:21,956 --> 00:51:25,627
- Countless has a nice ring to it.
- And how many lives have you saved?

730
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,684
Half a million.

731
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:32,600
The population of King's Landing.

732
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:40,263
You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.

733
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:45,184
Did you... did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

734
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,900
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

735
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,050
Lord Selwyn Tarth

736
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,427
offered 300 gold dragons for
his daughter's safe return.

737
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:59,140
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

738
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,433
Why not?

739
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:06,630
He's convinced Lord Tarth
owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

740
00:52:07,997 --> 00:52:09,875
He feels he's being cheated.

741
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:12,942
They'd be fools to kill her.

742
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:15,147
These men have been at war a long time.

743
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,484
Most of them will be dead by winter.

744
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:20,234
She'll be their entertainment tonight.

745
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,400
Beyond tonight,

746
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:25,154
I don't think they care very much.

747
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:46,188
We have to return to Harrenhal.

748
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:49,201
- Why?
- I've left something behind.

749
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:50,943
Absolutely not.

750
00:52:51,122 --> 00:52:54,464
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
- And what are those orders?

751
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,396
To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.

752
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,689
You think you'll get a reward.

753
00:53:02,507 --> 00:53:05,049
I serve Lord Bolton.

754
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:08,220
Any appreciation your father...
- You think you're getting a reward.

755
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,763
Let me explain something to you.

756
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:13,861
When my father sees me, the first thing
he's going to ask is what happened to my hand.

757
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:16,838
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

758
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:18,667
- I had nothing...
- Or I could tell him...

759
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:21,071
this man saved my life.

760
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:25,612
We return to Harrenhal now.

761
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:51,071
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

762
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,862
Don't spare her.

763
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:16,660
Don't spare her!

764
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:22,588
Well, this is one shameful fucking performance.

765
00:54:22,618 --> 00:54:24,488
Stop running and fight.

766
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:33,286
A wooden sword?

767
00:54:33,316 --> 00:54:36,289
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

768
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,448
- We've only got one bear.
- I'll pay her bloody ransom.

769
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:43,177
Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
Just get her out of there.

770
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:45,454
All you lords and ladies

771
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:48,730
still think that the only
thing that matters is gold.

772
00:54:48,764 --> 00:54:52,171
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

773
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:55,117
And that makes me happier than all her sapphires.

774
00:54:55,147 --> 00:54:57,458
So go buy yourself a golden hand

775
00:54:57,488 --> 00:55:00,375
and fuck yourself with it.

776
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:21,332
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

777
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:33,839
What the fuck are you doing to my bear?

778
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:37,533
Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back
to King's Landing alive

779
00:55:37,563 --> 00:55:39,628
and that's what I aim to do.

780
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:44,006
Pull her up.

781
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,106
Hold my legs.

782
00:56:22,241 --> 00:56:23,638
Pull him up!

783
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:36,100
The bitch stays.

784
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:41,071
We're taking her to King's Landing.

785
00:56:41,105 --> 00:56:43,127
Unless you kill me.

786
00:56:45,057 --> 00:56:46,977
She belongs to me.

787
00:56:47,212 --> 00:56:49,353
Lord Bolton's orders.

788
00:56:49,383 --> 00:56:52,172
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

789
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:55,598
Getting his pet rat a reward
or ensuring Tywin Lannister

790
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:57,215
gets his son back alive?

791
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:20,537
Well, we must be on our way.

792
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,680
Sorry about the sapphires.

793
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:49,028
