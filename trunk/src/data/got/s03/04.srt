1
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:02,064
<i>Why're you helping him?</i>

2
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:03,859
He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?

3
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:05,406
You're not our prisoner, little lady.

4
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:06,694
You're lucky we found you.

5
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:10,124
These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.

6
00:00:10,157 --> 00:00:12,491
Ride east. Your sister's waiting for you.

7
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,852
Come on. Come on.

8
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:17,402
I'm waiting for word on an assignment
that will take me far away from the capital.

9
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:19,541
I might be able to take you with me.

10
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:20,943
Watch out for her.

11
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,710
Watch out for her with him.

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,105
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

13
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,112
My Lord

14
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:29,642
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible.

15
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,551
I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera.

16
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:34,735
We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.

17
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:36,732
And we have much farther to go.

18
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:39,730
What have we here? Frozen crows?

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,636
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.

20
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,526
That pig's got value to me.

21
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,822
What is it?

22
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,039
Come, my lord.
You're a long way from home... 

23
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:00,446
and winter is coming.

24
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,499
I want to buy them all. 8,000.

25
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,816
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.

26
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,086
I have dragons.

27
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:09,567
They want the biggest one.

28
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:10,770
Done.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,474
I'll take you as well, now.

30
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:16,212
You think you're the smartest man there is.

31
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,577
And if you get in any trouble,
all you've got to do is say "my father."

32
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,942
You're nothing without your daddy.

33
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,543
Never forget that.

34
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:27,030
Here, this should help you remember.

53
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,109
Please. Please.

00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,959
If I die, you won't be getting...

00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,256
Enough.

56
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,310
Here.

57
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:44,983
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

58
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:12,149
Stop!

59
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:22,585
Far enough.

60
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,536
Do that again and I'll take your other hand.

61
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,027
Come on, you.

62
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,006
Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

63
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,514
I hope we might speak.

64
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:19,801
In confidence.

65
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:22,446
Oh, always in confidence.

66
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:25,096
About the events of the Blackwater.

67
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,609
- Perhaps this is the wrong time?
- Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.

68
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:34,955
I thought one of your little birds might have
knowledge of my sister's intentions to...

69
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,572
End your life?

70
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:41,004
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies
along with his position, I'm afraid.

71
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,497
Which is why I'm coming to you.

72
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,604
- I need proof.
- Proof?

73
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,178
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

74
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,889
I have no proof...

75
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:52,522
only whispers.

76
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:58,497
Before all this nastiness,

77
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:02,629
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

78
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:06,050
Do you want to hear it still?
- I don't know. Do I?

79
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:10,931
As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors
through the Free Cities.

80
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,972
One day in Myr,

81
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:17,565
a certain man made my master an offer
too tempting to refuse.

82
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:22,686
I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard
some men used small boys.

83
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,373
But what he wanted was far worse.

84
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:30,256
He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,

85
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:32,873
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

86
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:35,739
With a hooked blade he sliced me,

87
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,512
root and stem, chanting all the while.

88
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:41,939
He burned my parts in a brazier.

89
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,956
The flames turned blue

90
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,105
and I heard a voice answer his call.

91
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:54,724
I still dream of that night.

92
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,949
Not of the sorcerer,

93
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:00,069
not of his blade.

94
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,589
I dream of the voice from the flames.

95
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,411
Was it a god? A demon?

96
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,348
A conjuror's trick?

97
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:08,648
I don't know.

98
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:13,016
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.

99
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:15,047
And ever since that day,

100
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:19,241
I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

101
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,695
But you can see why I was eager to aid

102
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:25,261
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

103
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,135
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

104
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:29,728
Yes.

105
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,724
I feel the need for actual revenge...

106
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,935
against the actual person

107
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,203
who tried to have me killed.

108
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:40,655
Which will require a degree of influence, which...

109
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:42,727
You do not possess...

110
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:44,530
at the moment.

111
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,156
But influence is largely

112
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,239
a matter of patience, I have found.

113
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:54,778
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,

114
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:57,501
he threw me out of his house to die.

115
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,961
I resolved to live

116
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,827
to spite him.

117
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:03,127
I begged.

118
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,421
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.

119
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,257
I became an excellent thief

120
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:12,710
and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters

121
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,647
are more valuable than the contents of his purse.

122
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,945
Step by step,

123
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:21,616
one distasteful task after another,

124
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:24,582
I made my way from the slums of Myr

125
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,574
to the small council chamber.

126
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,036
Influence grows like a weed.

127
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,614
I tended mine patiently

128
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:40,457
until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep

129
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:44,080
all the way across to the far side of the world

130
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,500
where I managed to wrap them around something

131
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,028
very special.

132
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:55,829
The sorcerer.

133
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,902
Hello, my old friend.

134
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:03,065
It's been a long time.

135
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:08,697
I have no doubt the revenge you want
will be yours in time...

136
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,301
if you have the stomach for it.

137
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:17,807
When people talk about the Night's Watch,

138
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:20,161
they never mention the shoveling.

139
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,534
Or the shit.

140
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:25,450
They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes,

141
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,067
and protecting the realm,

142
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:30,741
but shoveling really is most of it.

143
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:34,568
And getting attacked or killed or worse.

144
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:36,932
And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

145
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:38,952
usually you're shoveling.

146
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,870
Oh, look.

147
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:42,725
More shit.

148
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:47,980
I was starting to wonder what to do
with the rest of my day.

149
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,810
We need to get out of here.

150
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,911
When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.

151
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,853
The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.

152
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:59,569
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

153
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,219
We do now.

154
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,192
We know what's out there.
Craster's been out here...

155
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:05,722
surviving.

156
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:08,643
So he's your new protector now?

157
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,243
Our good friend Craster?

158
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,476
We're like the sons he never had.

159
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,206
Mormont isn't gonna save you.

160
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,503
This lummox here isn't gonna save you.

161
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:21,829
When the walkers come calling,
Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.

162
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,812
If we want to live...

163
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:29,903
we'll have to look out for ourselves.

164
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:44,925
You woke him.

165
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,333
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:50,293
He's beautiful.

167
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,393
He's beautiful.

168
00:11:58,693 --> 00:11:59,743
Does he have a name?

169
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,125
No.

170
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:03,324
Are you going to give him one?

171
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,485
Why?

172
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,033
Here.

173
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,664
Gilly.
- You said to hold it for you until you came back.

174
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:15,282
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

175
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,367
I don't want your stupid thimble.

176
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:20,127
I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that?

177
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,624
Can you?

178
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,010
I don't have time for you.

179
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:29,373
I don't have time for anyone but him

180
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,219
because he doesn't have much time.

181
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:58,647
You have to go after him.

182
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:00,456
How?

183
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,458
You know how.

184
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:28,456
Brandon.

185
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,040
- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?

186
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,929
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

187
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,942
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

188
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:39,082
No more climbing. Promise me.

189
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,663
Promise me! Promise me!

190
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,913
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

191
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,177
<i>Promise me!</i>

192
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,419
Is he very large?

193
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,128
No larger than usual, apparently.

194
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:04,188
- And yet they said that he was...
- Extraordinary.

195
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:07,016
The most extraordinary man they've ever had.

196
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:08,685
And they've had a lot of men.

197
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,518
We're talking about the same Podrick?

198
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,853
The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service?

199
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:15,083
Seems a bit simple?

200
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,589
What did he do to them?

201
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:19,050
I don't know, my lord.

202
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,322
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

203
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:22,802
So what did they say?

204
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,830
They said it was hard to describe.

205
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,230
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

206
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:36,876
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

207
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,280
He was too preoccupied to notice.

208
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,132
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.

209
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,998
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

210
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:47,153
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love
of the Lady Arryn

211
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:49,097
and the title that comes with her.

212
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:51,055
Sad, really.

213
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:56,435
Is that all it takes to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

214
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:00,840
He hasn't spoken to her since the last time,
as far as I know.

215
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:04,023
But I don't think he's lost interest.

216
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,206
What makes you say so?

217
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:11,103
His shipboard inventory.

218
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:14,393
You can read.

219
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,650
Rare for a woman in your profession.

220
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,480
- Former profession.
- Of course.

221
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:22,963
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

222
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,797
Two featherbeds.

223
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:27,657
He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.

224
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:31,905
Who is important enough to Littlefinger

225
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:35,062
to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger?

226
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:37,272
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

227
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,304
He's not interested in them, my lord.

228
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,414
How do you know?

229
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,526
Because I'm one of his girls.

230
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,312
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

231
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:51,889
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother,

232
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:54,223
or rather his dragon.

233
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,940
It ate her while her son watched.

234
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:01,647
What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.

235
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:07,950
The ceremony is traditionally
held in the main sanctum,

236
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,022
which seats 700 comfortably.

237
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,531
There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere
on the premises for everyone else.

238
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,586
There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.

239
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:22,731
No, the rest are there to look adoringly

240
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,799
upon the 700 to remind them

241
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,918
how superior they must be to have the best seats.

242
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:29,537
Over there in that urn,

243
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,697
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

244
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,908
Aerion Brightflame they called him.

245
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:37,342
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

246
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,351
He was wrong.

247
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,199
And, of course, there's the Mad King,

248
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,957
killed by my uncle.

249
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,424
Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?

250
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:50,603
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?

251
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,292
Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace.

252
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,702
I'd love to see their tombs, really.

253
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,755
It's like taking a walk through history.

254
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,546
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

255
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,169
You were married here, Your Grace?

256
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:07,983
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

257
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,825
Seems like a lifetime ago.

258
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,591
Your husband, was he buried here as well?

259
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:15,651
No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.

260
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,714
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

261
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,748
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

262
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:21,858
I should say not.

263
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:24,535
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget

264
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,192
he's never been within a mile of a real battle.

265
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:28,872
I seem to recall...

266
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:31,826
he laid siege to Storm's End
for the better part of a year.

267
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,693
All he laid siege to

268
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:36,428
was the banquet table in the command tent.

269
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,412
I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.

270
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:42,442
He had no business fighting an actual warrior.

271
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,870
We mothers...

272
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,726
do what we can
to keep our sons from the grave.

273
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:50,606
But they do seem to yearn for it.

274
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:53,074
We shower them with good sense,

275
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,383
and it slides right off like rain off a wing.

276
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,734
And yet the world belongs to them.

277
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,663
A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.

278
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:10,659
The gods have seen fit to make it so.

279
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:12,442
My father didn't want them here.

280
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,676
He was going to have their bodies burned

281
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:16,677
and thrown in the Blackwater,

282
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,816
but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.

283
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,534
I'm glad he did.

284
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:26,821
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
I know they did terrible things at the end,

285
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,824
but their ancestors built this.

286
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,061
Sometimes severity
is the price we pay for greatness.

287
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,059
I couldn't agree more.

288
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,034
Shall we go and see them?

289
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:55,135
If you give them your love,

290
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,202
they will return it a thousandfold.

291
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:00,912
I've spoken with them.

292
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,262
I know how they feel about you.

293
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:06,545
You led the defense of King's Landing.

294
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,369
They adore you.

295
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:19,948
Open the doors.

296
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,941
Joffrey.

297
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:32,665
Wait.

298
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,912
<i>- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!</i>

299
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:38,493
<i>Bless you, Lady Margaery!</i>

300
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,345
<i>Long live Lady Margaery!</i>

301
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,456
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

302
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,044
<i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

303
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,467
How far is it to Deepwood Motte?

304
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:05,997
Not far, my lord.

305
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,155
Your sister is waiting for you there.

306
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:10,381
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

307
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:14,202
I served them, the men who were torturing you.

308
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:17,072
I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.

309
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:19,156
Why would you risk your life for me?

310
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,494
I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.

311
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,601
I was only a boy when they took you away.

312
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:26,494
My father brought me and my
brothers up to the...

313
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:29,824
bluffs so we could watch
the ship that carried you off.

314
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:33,372
I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,

315
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:36,602
"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."

316
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:39,686
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

317
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,116
when I saw what they were doing to you.

318
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,391
Those men,

319
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,829
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

320
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:50,423
Did he?

321
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:53,305
I don't know, my lord.

322
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:55,428
They...

323
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,433
they never told me much.

324
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:08,642
My sister's men are loyal to her.

325
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,440
We don't need to hide from them.

326
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,301
Not all those are your sister's men.

327
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,876
Some of them are loyal to your father.

328
00:21:19,684 --> 00:21:21,960
- What is it?
- I was just thinking how jealous I was

329
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,110
when my father told Yara to take this place.

330
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,929
What did he tell you to do?

331
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,489
Raid fishing villages.

332
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,091
He didn't trust me.

333
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,989
Thought I was a Stark.

334
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,234
I could never be a Stark.

335
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:37,414
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.

336
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:38,980
- He lorded it over you?

337
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,760
Didn't have to.
All he had to do was...

338
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,056
be.

339
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:46,462
Be who he was born to be.

340
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,894
His life fit him better than his clothes.

341
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:52,934
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

342
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:54,421
He's the King in the North.

343
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,870
And me...

344
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,431
my father gave me a choice

345
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:00,352
and I made it.

346
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,231
I could never be a Stark.

347
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:05,828
But ironborn,

348
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,026
that's what I was born to be.

349
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:17,871
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.

350
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,558
I murdered those boys.

351
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,958
The Stark boys?

352
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,226
Never found them.

353
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:38,454
Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.

354
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:43,655
I let Dagmer slit their throats

355
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:46,294
and I let him burn the bodies...

356
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:50,856
so I could keep Winterfell...

357
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:54,819
and make my father proud.

358
00:22:56,068 --> 00:22:57,899
Maybe it's not too late.

359
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:03,024
It is.

360
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,922
My real father lost his head at King's Landing.

361
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:18,469
I made a choice...

362
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:23,133
and I chose wrong.

363
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,390
And now I've burned everything down.

364
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,095
Not everything, my lord.

365
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,113
She's up here.

366
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:50,957
Yara.

367
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,082
Wait.

368
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,417
I brought him back. He killed the others.

369
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:05,520
What?

370
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,746
No, I didn't.

371
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,247
You can't!

372
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,571
No, please stop!

373
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:14,746
No!

374
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:18,553
Put him back where he belongs.

375
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:44,309
Eat.

376
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,696
What are you doing?

377
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,245
I'm dying.

378
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:54,266
You can't die.

379
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,482
You need to live

380
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:00,132
to take revenge.

381
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:03,101
I don't care about revenge.

382
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,319
You coward.

383
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:09,224
A little misfortune and you're giving up.

384
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,382
Misfor...

385
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,382
misfortune?
- You lost your hand.

386
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,548
My sword hand. I was that hand.

387
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:22,759
You have a taste...

388
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:25,245
one taste of the real world

389
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:28,945
where people have important things taken from them

390
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:32,612
and you whine and cry and quit.

391
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:34,896
You sound like a bloody woman.

392
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,542
I know what you did for me.

393
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,406
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

394
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,429
It's called the Sapphire Isle
because of the blue of its water.

395
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,598
You knew that.

396
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,827
Why did you help me?

397
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:57,652
You wanted to speak to me?

398
00:26:57,857 --> 00:26:59,730
Yes, about Jaime.

399
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,768
What about him?

400
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,410
I wanted to make sure
we're doing everything we can to get him back.

401
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:12,603
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner...

402
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:17,005
what did I do in response?
- You started a war.

403
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,044
And if I would start a war
for that lecherous little stump,

404
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:24,824
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

405
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,954
Whatever you can.

406
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:29,285
Whatever I can.

407
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,196
- You're still here.
- Yes.

408
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,368
Why?

409
00:27:49,613 --> 00:27:53,975
Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence and your trust,

410
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,377
not your sons?

411
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,750
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

412
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:01,735
Years and years of lectures on family
and legacy...

413
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:07,503
the same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations...

414
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:10,779
did it ever occur to you that your daughter
might be the only one listening to them?

415
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:12,906
Living by them?

416
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:16,372
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

417
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:20,252
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

418
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:28,040
All right.

419
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,475
Contribute.

420
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:33,955
The Tyrells are a problem.

421
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,603
The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.

422
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,783
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

423
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:46,575
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

424
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:49,692
She knows how to manipulate him.

425
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:51,063
Good.

426
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:54,801
I wish you knew how to manipulate him.

427
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:57,631
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.

428
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:01,243
I distrust you because you're not
as smart as you think you are.

429
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,685
You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you
and everyone else in this city.

430
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,756
Perhaps...

431
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:18,117
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

432
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:23,407
I will.

433
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,162
Do you like it, Nana?

434
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,146
Another golden rose. How original.

435
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,622
I eat from plates stamped with roses.

436
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:34,857
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

437
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:37,708
I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot,

438
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:40,115
as if that makes it smell any better.

439
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,116
Roses are boring, dear.

440
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,184
"Growing strong."

441
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,385
The dullest words of any house.

442
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,778
"Winter is coming!"

443
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,689
Now that's memorable.

444
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,316
"We do not sow."

445
00:29:53,346 --> 00:29:56,743
Strong. Strong.
Those are houses you watch out for.

446
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,746
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

447
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:03,628
But a golden rose growing strong...

448
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,210
that strikes fear in the heart.

449
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:09,834
Look, little loves.

450
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:12,406
A spider in the garden.

451
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:15,709
Run along now.

452
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,416
Grow strong.

453
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:21,102
My lady.

454
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:24,470
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

455
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,207
The city has been made brighter by your presence.

456
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:30,258
The city is made brighter by my presence?

457
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,516
Is that your usual line, Lord Varys?

458
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:34,331
Are you here to seduce me?

459
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,674
A little obvious, perhaps.

460
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,665
Oh, no, please.

461
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,006
Seduce away. It's been so long.

462
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,457
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

463
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:47,871
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

464
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,693
A question for the philosophers.

465
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,845
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

466
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,629
- So?
- Might I sit?

467
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:56,659
No.

468
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:00,622
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.

469
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,360
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

470
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,204
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.

471
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:08,293
Have I?

472
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,348
Because I spoke to her once in this garden

473
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:13,585
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

474
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:15,948
Why shouldn't I take an interest?
- She's an interesting girl.

475
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:18,722
- Is she?
- No, not particularly.

476
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,428
But she's had an interesting childhood.

477
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,615
She has...

478
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:22,968
sadly.

479
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,875
Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.

480
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,894
I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.

481
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,532
Come, come.

482
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,189
You surrender rather easily.

483
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,721
Walk with me.
I know the walls have ears,

484
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:40,385
but apparently the shrubbery does, too.

485
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,911
I choose my allies carefully

486
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:45,827
and my enemies more carefully still.

487
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,071
Which is Sansa Stark?

488
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:50,671
Neither. A babe in the woods.

489
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,878
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

490
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:55,084
Ned Stark had many admirers,

491
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:59,135
and how many stepped forward
when the executioner came for his head?

492
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:02,387
I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.

493
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:03,468
- How?

494
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:07,638
You're not the only one who
has taken an interest in her.

495
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,542
That's hardly surprising.

496
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:12,703
- She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
- Indeed.

497
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,315
She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

498
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:18,356
It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.

499
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,895
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

500
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:25,617
A confidant of mine has told me
that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.

501
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:28,156
And why have you come to me with this matter?

502
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:32,089
Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.

503
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,924
He has acquired the first two.
How long before he has the army?

504
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,986
Perhaps you'll laugh,

505
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:41,996
but I know him better than most
and this is the truth.

506
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:45,836
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

507
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,018
If Robb Stark falls,

508
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:51,238
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

509
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:54,420
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

510
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,072
Which seems such a shame.

511
00:32:56,102 --> 00:33:00,939
Why should a man with such a low reputation
steal away such a lovely bride?

512
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,656
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

513
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:07,388
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

514
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:11,573
But he would see this country burn
if he could be king of the ashes.

515
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,695
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
You are too kind.

516
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,905
I believe I have a possible solution.

517
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:23,175
One doesn't need to be clever for that.
It's all rather obvious, isn't it?

518
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:38,537
- I didn't mean to disturb you.
- You haven't.

519
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:43,869
We'd like some privacy, please.
If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.

520
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:50,351
Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names,
I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.

521
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,246
What did you pray for?

522
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:57,960
I can't tell you.

523
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:02,037
Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

524
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:05,532
Let's see, for my family's health and happiness,

525
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:08,345
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

526
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:11,208
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.

527
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:15,127
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

528
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,572
My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

529
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:24,404
When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and
Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

530
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:28,128
Pig-face, she called me.
Pig-face? That's ridiculous.

531
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:30,143
I think it had something to do with my nose.

532
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,978
Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.

533
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:38,515
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

534
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:41,183
A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.

535
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:43,822
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

536
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:46,105
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats

537
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:49,304
and eventually your face slides
off and you die in agony.

538
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,258
But that's awful.

539
00:34:54,227 --> 00:34:57,832
You're...
I believed you!

540
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,941
- Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
- Don't say that. No, you're not.

541
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:03,990
So what happened to Alanna?

542
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:08,134
She grew up to be the most beautiful woman
and married a handsome lord and they have

543
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:13,164
darling children and live in a castle by the sea.
It's all terribly frustrating.

544
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:16,437
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

545
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:20,546
You'll be married here in the capital
and she'll have to come watch and

546
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,579
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

547
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,368
I want us to be friends, good friends.

548
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:32,060
That would make me very happy.

549
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:36,787
You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

550
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:40,232
We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.

551
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:43,446
You should see the costumes.
People work on them for months.

552
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,357
I don't think the queen
would let me leave King's Landing.

553
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:50,105
The Queen Regent, you mean.

554
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,381
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

555
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,257
And if you were to marry Loras...

556
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:05,095
Your place would be at
Highgarden, wouldn't it?

557
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:08,338
We would be sisters, you and I.

558
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:09,896
Would you like that?

559
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,058
His name was Bannen.

560
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:29,909
He was a good man,
a good ranger.

561
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,443
He came to us from...

562
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,658
where did he come from?

563
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:38,576
Down White Harbor way.

564
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:43,158
He came to us from White Harbor.
Never failed in his duty.

565
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:47,232
He kept his vows the best he could.

566
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:49,154
He rode far.

567
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,364
Fought fiercely.

568
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:56,104
We shall never see his like again.

569
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:58,945
And now his watch has ended.

570
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:02,793
And now his watch has ended.

571
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:10,164
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

572
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:12,717
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

573
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:16,112
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

574
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:18,229
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

575
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,834
You on his side?

576
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,756
We can't just show up and steal all his food.

577
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,165
We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.

578
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:28,573
The day we leave, Craster will...

579
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,708
tap a barrel of our wine

580
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:35,481
and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes
and laugh at us

581
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:37,650
starving in the snow.

582
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:43,685
He's a bloody wildling is all he is.

583
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:49,009
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.

584
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,328
You have one son...

585
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:03,233
don't you, Mormont?

586
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,170
I had my 99th.

587
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:11,357
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

588
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:15,511
And more daughters than I can count.

589
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,393
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

590
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:22,330
Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.

591
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,376
As soon as our wounded are strong enough.

592
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,432
They're as strong as they're gonna get.

593
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:31,670
Them that's dying,

594
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:34,809
why don't you cut their
throats and be done with it?

595
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,278
Or leave them if you've not the stomach

596
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,306
and I'll sort them myself.

597
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,240
Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?

598
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,589
- Wait outside.
- It's cold outside and...

599
00:38:52,077 --> 00:38:54,949
there's nothing to eat.
- My wives gave you bread.

600
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,343
There's sawdust in the bread.

601
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:59,403
You don't like it,

602
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:02,585
you go out there and eat the snow.

603
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:10,391
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.

604
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,305
I told you...

605
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:17,848
to wait outside.
- He's sitting there drinking our wine,

606
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:20,465
eating his fill while we die.

607
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,649
I gave you crows enough.

608
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,819
I've got to feed my women!
- So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then?

609
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,999
How else'd you make it through winter?
- Enough!

610
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:32,624
- Out!
- I am a godly man.

611
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:34,231
You're a stingy bastard!

612
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:35,356
Bastard?

613
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,798
Out with you, you little thief.

614
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,187
And you!

615
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:41,927
And you!

616
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,560
Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.

617
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,746
I'll chop the hands off the next man
who calls me bastard.

618
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,242
You are a bastard.

619
00:40:12,697 --> 00:40:14,147
A daughter-fucking...

620
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,477
wildling bastard.

621
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,965
The gods will curse us for this.

622
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:29,385
- By all the laws...
- There are no laws beyond the Wall.

623
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,585
Now show us where he hides the food
or you'll get the same as he did.

624
00:40:33,676 --> 00:40:34,928
Unhand her.

625
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,507
I shall have your head for this.

626
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:30,013
Quickly.

627
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:31,397
- Quickly.
- What's happening?

628
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:33,879
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go.

629
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:34,945
Now!

630
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,703
Follow me. I know the best way.

631
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:45,804
Come on.

632
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:53,810
Run fast, Piggy,

633
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,422
and sleep well!

634
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:59,111
I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.

635
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:07,722
- Can I take this hood off yet?
- I do apologize, little lady, but it's better

636
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:10,453
for you if you don't see where we're going.

637
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:17,049
Halt!

638
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,894
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

639
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:30,707
Not easy finding molasses in wartime.

640
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,604
I'd have some.

641
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:37,834
Let's go home.

642
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,449
What is this place?

643
00:42:56,656 --> 00:42:59,678
Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.

644
00:43:08,965 --> 00:43:11,531
You look like a bunch of swineherds.

645
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:13,523
Some of us were swineherds.

646
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:14,879
And some of us tanners...

647
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:16,612
and masons.

648
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:19,657
That was before.
- You're still swineherds

649
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:21,916
and tanners and masons.

650
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:25,865
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

651
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:26,895
No.

652
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:32,277
Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.

653
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:33,977
Beric Dondarrion?

654
00:43:34,749 --> 00:43:38,299
You've seen better days.
- And I won't see them again.

655
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,963
Stark deserters.

656
00:43:41,993 --> 00:43:44,040
Baratheon deserters.

657
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,316
You lot aren't fighting in a war.
You're running from it.

658
00:43:47,346 --> 00:43:50,480
Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog.

659
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,146
But here you are 1,000 miles from home.

660
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:58,296
Which of us is running?
- Untie these ropes and we'll find out.

661
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,805
What are you doing...

662
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:01,636
leading a mob of peasants?

663
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:04,451
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother

664
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:05,985
in King Robert's name.

665
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,250
Ned Stark is dead.

666
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:10,333
King Robert is dead.

667
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,411
My brother's alive.

668
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:16,928
You're fighting for ghosts.

669
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:18,439
That's what we are...

670
00:44:18,894 --> 00:44:19,976
Ghosts.

671
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:22,368
Waiting for you in the dark.

672
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,650
You can't see us,

673
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,556
but we see you.

674
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,333
No matter whose cloak you wear...

675
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,948
Lannister, Stark, Baratheon...

676
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:34,086
you prey on the weak,

677
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:36,886
the Brotherhood without
Banners will hunt you down.

678
00:44:37,058 --> 00:44:38,243
You found god?

679
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:39,782
<i>- Is that it?
- Aye.</i>

680
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,687
 I've been reborn
in the light of the one true god.

681
00:44:44,621 --> 00:44:46,080
As have we all.

682
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,589
As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.

683
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,504
If you mean to murder me,
then bloody well get on with it.

684
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:54,001
You'll die soon enough, dog.

685
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,229
But it won't be murder.

686
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:58,050
Only justice.

687
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,970
And a kinder fate than you deserve.

688
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:01,823
Lions you call yourselves.

689
00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:05,211
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped

690
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:07,136
and babes still on the breast were

691
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,252
cut in two while their mothers watched.
- I wasn't

692
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:11,165
at the Mummer's Ford.

693
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,398
Dump your dead children at some other door.

694
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:16,015
House Clegane was built upon dead children.

695
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,752
I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys

696
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,062
before the Iron Throne.

697
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,269
Do you take me for my brother?

698
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:25,237
- Is being born Clegane a crime?
- Murder is a crime.

699
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,672
I never touched the Targaryen babes.

700
00:45:27,702 --> 00:45:29,250
I never saw them...

701
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,845
 never smelled them,
never heard them bawling.

702
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,423
You want to cut my throat...

703
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:36,113
get on with it!

704
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:39,924
But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.

705
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:41,687
You murdered Mycah.

706
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:44,108
The butcher's boy.

707
00:45:44,264 --> 00:45:45,414
My friend.

708
00:45:45,897 --> 00:45:47,403
He was 12 years old.

709
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:48,633
He was unarmed.

710
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,431
And you rode him down.

711
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:53,630
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

712
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,048
<i>Aye, he was a bleeder.</i>

713
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:58,455
You don't deny killing this boy?

714
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:01,181
I was Joffrey's sworn shield.
The boy attacked the prince.

715
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:04,211
That's a lie!
I hit Joffrey.

716
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:05,880
Mycah just ran away.

717
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,512
Then I should have killed you.

718
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,492
Not my place to question princes.

719
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:13,768
You stand accused of murder.

720
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:16,626
But no one here knows the truth of the charge,

721
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:18,921
so it is not for us to judge you.

722
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:22,581
Only the Lord of Light may do that now.

723
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:26,494
I sentence you to trial by combat.

724
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:30,492
So, who will it be?

725
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:35,049
Should we find out if your fire god
really loves you, priest?

726
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:37,094
Or you, archer? 

727
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,801
What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?

728
00:46:40,836 --> 00:46:44,486
Or is the little girl the bravest one here?

729
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,086
<i>Aye.</i>

730
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:49,555
She might be.

731
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,158
But it's me you'll fight.

732
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:21,269
The master says they are untested.

733
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:26,606
He says you would be wise to blood them early.

734
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,901
There are many small cities
between here and there,

735
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,531
cities ripe for sacking.

736
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:34,926
Should you take captives,

737
00:47:34,956 --> 00:47:37,873
the masters will buy the healthy
ones and for a good price.

738
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,564
And who knows?

739
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:46,613
In 10 years...

740
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:50,458
 some of the boys you send them
may be Unsullied in their turn.

741
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:52,638
Thus all shall prosper.

742
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:48,532
Is it done, then?

743
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,853
They belong to me?

744
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:54,210
It is done.

745
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,813
You hold the whip.

746
00:50:29,432 --> 00:50:30,681
Dracarys.

747
00:53:29,244 --> 00:53:32,144
