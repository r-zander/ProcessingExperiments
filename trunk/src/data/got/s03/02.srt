1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,330
<i>Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?</i>

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,590
I saw Craster take his own baby
boy and leave it in the woods.

3
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:08,071
I saw what took it.

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,177
When I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.

5
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,142
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,880
How did you kill those guards?
Show me how.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,644
If you would learn, you must come with me.

8
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,897
I want to, but I need to
find my brother and mother.

9
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,238
And my sister.

10
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,512
<i>You have to go.</i>

11
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:26,318
Go to the Wall, to Jon.

12
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,821
Osha, you must protect them.

13
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:30,899
You're the only one who can.

14
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,743
200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.

15
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,713
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

16
00:00:36,743 --> 00:00:38,622
For them and for your sons.

17
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:40,469
They rot in the ground

18
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,543
while their killer runs free.

19
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:44,419
Those were Stark men.

20
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,870
I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

21
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,520
I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,096
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage
at Flea Bottom this morning.

23
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:56,911
<i>I paid a visit to an orphanage
the High Septon told me about.</i>

24
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,601
Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there.

25
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,395
The king barely escaped with his life.

26
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:04,189
My mother's always had a penchant for drama.

27
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,192
Facts become less and less important to her
as she grows older.

28
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,028
You said you'd take me home.

29
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:11,696
If you were to tell just one...

30
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:14,359
Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

31
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,473
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

32
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:17,439
Watch out for her with him.

33
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:25,577
We need to get back to the Wall.

34
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,143
We know what's out there,

35
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,577
but we have to warn them.

40
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,548
Don't think too much, Bran.

41
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,644
Relax your bow arm.

42
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:27,494
<i>And which one of you was a marksman at 10?</i>

43
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,657
Father?

44
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,016
You can't kill it, you know.

45
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,728
Why not?

46
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,234
Because the raven is you.

47
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,827
It's all right, Hodor.

48
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:08,507
Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?

49
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:09,704
No.

50
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:11,841
It was the three-eyed raven.

51
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:13,107
He's back.

52
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:17,136
I tried to kill it, but I couldn't.

53
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,884
- There was a boy.
- I don't want to hear about it.

54
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:22,126
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

55
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,699
We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.

56
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:28,209
I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

57
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,096
I know you didn't, little lord.

58
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:33,257
We need to move.

59
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,457
We don't know who might be after us.

60
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,292
No one even knows we're alive.

61
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,555
And who told you that?

62
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,320
The three-eyed raven tell you?

63
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:44,311
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

64
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,093
I don't know what other people
know and what they don't.

65
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:52,889
I only know the Wall is a long way off.

66
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:06,782
My mother always told me
you Westerosi were a grim lot.

67
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:08,847
Grim...

68
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,454
bearded,

69
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:14,905
stinking barbarians
that would row across the Narrow Sea

70
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,930
and steal us from our beds.

71
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,274
Did you ever think you'd marry one?

72
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,232
I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

73
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:25,512
Never?

74
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,636
Not until I met the king of the...

75
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,375
grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

76
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,928
Pardon me, Your Grace.

77
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:42,711
My queen.

78
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:49,440
Let me guess which one is the good news.

79
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,697
Word from Riverrun

80
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:54,597
and Winterfell.

81
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:01,938
I hadn't seen him in years.

82
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,688
I don't even know how many.

83
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:10,012
We'll travel to the funeral together.

84
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:13,774
Lord Bolton will garrison here
until we return.

85
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,158
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

86
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:25,459
Something else?

87
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:29,711
By the time Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell,

88
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,894
the ironborn were gone.

89
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,577
They massacred everyone and
put the castle to the torch.

90
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,020
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.

91
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,581
They may have escaped.

92
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:51,535
Or Theon may have taken them back
to the Iron Islands as hostages.

93
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,482
Have you received any demands?

94
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,335
- No.
- Have you heard anything from Theon at all?

95
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:21,765
Where am I?

96
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,264
Who are you?

97
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,004
What do you want?

98
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,704
I want to do this.

99
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:48,587
Do you know how long it's going to take us
to get to King's Landing

100
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:50,159
walking through fields and forests?

101
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,189
Yes.

102
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,743
So how shall we pass the time?

103
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:56,755
By putting one foot in front of the other.

104
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,919
It's going to be a very dull walk.

105
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,520
I'm here to take you to King's Landing

106
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,268
and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.

107
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,907
Dull is fine.

108
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:08,384
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

109
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,184
no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute.

110
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:12,280
Trust me on this.

111
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:14,898
People have been serving me since I was born.

112
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:18,027
You think Lady Stark is going
to want a giant towheaded plank

113
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,427
following her around for the rest of her life?

114
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:24,066
A week's journey with you and she'll
order you to fall on your sword.

115
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,770
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

116
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,729
I'm sure she'll let me know.

117
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,223
She's an honest woman.

118
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,299
All the good it's done her.

119
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,100
How did you come into Lady Stark's service?

120
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,014
There's something we can talk about.
- Not your concern, Kingslayer.

121
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,835
It had to be recently.

122
00:09:46,865 --> 00:09:48,800
You weren't with her at Winterfell.

123
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,704
How would you know?

124
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:53,035
Because I visited Winterfell.

125
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:56,752
I would have noticed your dour head
smacking into the archways.

126
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:58,779
Move.

127
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:07,065
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

128
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,095
Ah, Renly.

129
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:09,927
Really?

130
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:13,617
He wasn't fit to rule over anything
more important than a 12-course meal.

131
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,626
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

132
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,820
I lived with him at court since
he was a boy, don't forget.

133
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,931
Could hardly escape the little tulip.

134
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:23,896
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

135
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:27,658
I knew him far better than you.
- I knew him as well as anyone.

136
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:31,244
As a member of his Kingsguard,
he trusted me with everything.

137
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,882
He would have been a wonderful king.
- Sounds like you quite fancied him.

138
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,980
I did not fancy him.

139
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,324
Oh, gods, you did.

140
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,545
Did you ever tell him?

141
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,075
No, of course not.

142
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:46,175
You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.

143
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:50,046
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

144
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:52,032
You're far too much man for him.

145
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:55,693
- I'm not interested in foul rumors.
- Unless they're about me.

146
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,822
It's all true about Renly.

147
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:01,191
His proclivities were the
worst kept secret at court.

148
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,182
It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.

149
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,626
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

150
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,500
I don't blame him.

151
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:11,578
And I don't blame you, either.

152
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,311
We don't get to choose who we love.

153
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:28,991
- Where are you headed, then?
- South.

154
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,175
- You?
- Riverrun.

155
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:33,952
Staying off the kingsroad, are you?

156
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,574
They get you no matter where you go.
- You can't win.

157
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:38,883
No, you really can't.

158
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:40,684
Looks like you're safe enough, though.

159
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:44,746
Meaning no offense, my lady, but...
I wouldn't tangle with you.

160
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,133
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

161
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:58,532
- He knows who I am.
- He doesn't.

162
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:02,812
Maybe you're right.
But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?

163
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:06,559
We're not doing it.

164
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,828
He's an innocent man.

165
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:12,012
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?

166
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,260
Make it tighter here.

167
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,482
That's better.

168
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,334
It makes you look very strong.

169
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,034
No flowers.

170
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,169
I said no flowers.

171
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,039
All these are wrong. Bring others.

172
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:40,674
Yes, Your Grace.

173
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,168
Bloody flowers.

174
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,678
On the king.

175
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:48,081
Looks like a Tyrell rose.

176
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,401
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.

177
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:53,519
Should be more than enough fabric.

178
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:00,802
Tell me what you think of her.

179
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,271
Who?

180
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:06,023
She's an ideal match.

181
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,134
With the Tyrells beside us,

182
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,175
we'll crush the Northerners.

183
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:13,573
Hang their lords, burn their strongholds,

184
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,145
sow their fields with salt,

185
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:18,936
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

186
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:22,915
It is a good match, but what do you think of her?

187
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,988
She's beautiful and intelligent.

188
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:30,790
Yes, she is.

189
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:34,594
Her concern with the well-being of
the common people is interesting.

190
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:37,130
Not to me.

191
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,279
I only meant that to go out of
your way to endanger yourself...

192
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:45,906
This is becoming one of the most boring
conversations I've ever had.

193
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,522
Margaery Tyrell dotes on
filthy urchins for a reason.

194
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:56,400
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.

195
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,169
She married a traitor and known degenerate
like Renly Baratheon for a reason.

196
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,677
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

197
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,760
That's what intelligent women do.

198
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,458
What they're told.

199
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,993
- You need to ask yourself...
- I don't need to do anything.

200
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:27,919
Better.

201
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,776
Much better.

202
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,145
I still don't believe it.

203
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,708
He didn't. He didn't want anything.

204
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,042
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

205
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:44,587
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.

206
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,948
Littlefinger's not in love with me.

207
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,327
Love is not the thing he wants.

208
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,763
He's too old.

209
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,965
They never see it that way.

210
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,804
He didn't ask you to do something for him?

211
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,044
Spy on someone or...?

212
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,341
No.

213
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,283
If he does ask you for anything

214
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,285
or try anything

215
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,655
or touch you, I want you to tell me.

216
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,646
Why? What will you do?

217
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,929
I will make him stop.

218
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,017
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

219
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:36,993
Send him in.

220
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:51,454
My sister Margaery invites you to take
the air with her and our grandmother

221
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,477
the Lady Olenna in the gardens.

222
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:56,588
May I escort you to them?

223
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,235
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

224
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,299
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

225
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,272
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

226
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:18,677
At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.

227
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,614
A rose, a red rose.

228
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,316
Of course I did.

229
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,291
<i>It's more your color.
You take it.</i>

230
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,459
You're such a dear.

231
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,528
I'll take my leave.

232
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,533
Thank you, Ser Loras.

233
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,535
Come.

234
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:52,179
Lady Sansa, it is my honor
to present my grandmother...

235
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,716
the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.

236
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,752
Kiss me, child.

237
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,943
It's so good of you to visit me
and my foolish flock of hens.

238
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:04,126
We're very sorry for your losses.

239
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:07,776
And I was sorry when I heard of
Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

240
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,065
He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

241
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,078
And charming and very clean.

242
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:14,274
He knew how to dress and smile and

243
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:16,975
somehow this gave him the
notion he was fit to be king.

244
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:19,179
Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.

245
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,880
Father liked him and so did Loras.

246
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,383
Loras is young and very good
at knocking men off horses with a stick.

247
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,463
That does not make him wise.

248
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,958
As to your fathead father...

249
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:31,454
Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?

250
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:35,532
She might think we have some wits about us.
One of us, at any rate.

251
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:38,201
It was treason. I warned them.

252
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:41,820
Robert has two sons and
Renly has an older brother.

253
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,871
How could he possibly have any claim
to that ugly iron chair?

254
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:49,329
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

255
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,112
But once the cow's been milked,

256
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:53,714
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

257
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:55,946
So here we are to see things through.

258
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,417
What do you say to that, Sansa?

259
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,706
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

260
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,190
Lemon cake's my favorite.

261
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,070
So we've been told.

262
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,794
Are you going to bring the food or
do you mean to starve us to death?

263
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:10,830
Here, Sansa,

264
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,056
come sit with me.

265
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,236
I'm much less boring than these others.

266
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:21,358
Do you know my son?

267
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,876
The Lord of Highgarden?

268
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,112
I haven't had the pleasure.

269
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,191
No great pleasure, believe me.

270
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:29,649
A ponderous oaf.

271
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,454
His father was an oaf as well.

272
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,947
My husband, the late Lord Luthor.

273
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:37,733
He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.

274
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:39,747
They say he was looking up at the sky

275
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:42,557
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

276
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:45,202
And now my son is doing the same,

277
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:48,428
only this time he's riding
a lion instead of a horse.

278
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,797
Now...

279
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:53,908
I want you to tell me the truth

280
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:57,327
about this royal boy, this Joffrey.

281
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:00,081
I... I...

282
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,550
You, you.

283
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,501
Who else would know better?

284
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:06,155
We've heard some troubling tales.

285
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,529
Is there any truth to them?

286
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,360
Has this boy mistreated you?

287
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,867
Has he ripped out your tongue?

288
00:19:13,897 --> 00:19:15,128
Joff... King...

289
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:18,270
Joffrey,
he... his Grace is...

290
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,775
very fair and...

291
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,324
handsome and as brave as a lion.

292
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,870
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

293
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:29,311
And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.

294
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,566
But how kind is he? How clever?

295
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,625
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

296
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,223
I'm to be his wife.

297
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,953
I only want to know what that means.

298
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:46,807
Bring me some cheese.

299
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,021
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

300
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,422
The cheese will be served when I want it served.

301
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,702
And I want it served now.

302
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,984
Are you frightened, child?

303
00:19:59,474 --> 00:20:01,274
No need for that.

304
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,175
We're only women here.

305
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,783
Tell us the truth.

306
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,990
No harm will come to you.

307
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:10,008
My father always told the truth.

308
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:11,126
Yes,

309
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,834
He had that reputation.

310
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:15,174
And they named him traitor and took his head.

311
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:20,048
Joffrey did that.

312
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:23,670
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

313
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,778
And he said that was mercy.

314
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,608
Then he took me up on the
walls and made me look at it.

315
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:34,519
Go on.

316
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,317
I can't. I never meant...

317
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,577
My father was a traitor.

318
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,479
My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.

319
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,367
Please don't make me say anymore.
- She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.

320
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,804
Speak freely, child.

321
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,727
We would never betray your confidence,
I swear it.

322
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:58,908
He's a monster.

323
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:04,143
That's a pity.

324
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,790
Please, don't stop the wedding.

325
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:07,709
Have no fear.

326
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:12,201
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden
is determined that Margaery shall be queen.

327
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,191
Even so, we thank you for the truth.

328
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,202
Here comes my cheese.

329
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:35,892
We're at war.

330
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:38,368
This march is a distraction.

331
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,608
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.

332
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:44,009
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

333
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:46,451
- No.
- Then it's a distraction.

334
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:51,812
My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.
We need his men.

335
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:54,492
Unless he's been breeding them,

336
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:56,636
he don't have enough to make a difference.

337
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,214
Have you lost faith in our cause?

338
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:01,094
If it's revenge...

339
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:03,901
I still got faith in it.
- If you no longer believe...

340
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:07,055
I can believe till it snows in Dorne.

341
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:08,828
Don't change the fact,

342
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:11,058
that we've got half the men.

343
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,365
You don't think we can win?

344
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,116
May I speak my mind, Your Grace?

345
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:20,446
Have you not been speaking
your mind, Lord Karstark?

346
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:23,804
I think you lost this war

347
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,301
the day you married her.

348
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,644
You're afraid of her.

349
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:45,892
And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

350
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:57,909
May I help you, Lady Stark?

351
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:58,998
No.

352
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,130
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
- You can't help...

353
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,658
because a mother
makes one for her children to protect them.

354
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,842
Only a mother can make them.

355
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,428
You've made them before?

356
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,070
Twice.

357
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,344
Did they work?

358
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,501
After a fashion.

359
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:35,629
I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.

360
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,808
Many years before that,
one of the boys came down with the pox.

361
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,576
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

362
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:52,318
But it would be a very long night.

363
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,820
So I sat with him all through the darkness.

364
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:02,512
Listened to his ragged little breaths,

365
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,543
his coughing, his whimpering.

366
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:07,541
Which boy?

367
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,612
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

368
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:18,592
I couldn't bear to look at him.

369
00:24:19,144 --> 00:24:20,996
I didn't want to see those brown

370
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,539
stranger's eyes staring up at me.

371
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,783
So I prayed to the gods.

372
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:28,681
Take him away. Make him die.

373
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:33,501
He got the pox.

374
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,790
And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.

375
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,259
A murderer.

376
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:47,743
I'd condemned this poor,

377
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,185
innocent child to a horrible death.

378
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,665
All because I was jealous of his mother.

379
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,785
A woman he didn't even know.

380
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,743
So I prayed to all seven gods,

381
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,326
let the boy live.

382
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:05,400
Let him live

383
00:25:06,302 --> 00:25:07,871
and I'll love him.

384
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:10,253
I'll be a mother to him.

385
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,601
I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,

386
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:18,568
to call him Stark and be done with it,

387
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:19,942
to make him one of us.

388
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:21,228
And he lived.

389
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,875
And he lived.

390
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:30,073
And I couldn't keep my promise.

391
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,399
And everything that's happened since then...

392
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,729
all this horror that's come to my family...

393
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:48,244
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

394
00:25:58,152 --> 00:26:00,937
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

395
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,368
Yes.

396
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:06,025
You liked him?

397
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:08,710
I like you, but...

398
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,524
if you're playing us false,
it won't be hard for me to kill you.

399
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:15,235
I've got wildling blood in my veins.
These are my people.

400
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:18,824
- I understand.
- Well, how could you understand?

401
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:21,811
You want to protect your people.

402
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:25,091
Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,

403
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:29,085
half of whom want to massacre the other half
for one insult or another?

404
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:33,067
They speak seven different languages in my army.

405
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:35,470
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.

406
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,921
The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.

407
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,127
Everyone hates the cave people.

408
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:41,264
So...

409
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:45,668
You know how I got moon worshippers
and cannibals and giants

410
00:26:45,698 --> 00:26:48,448
to march together in the same army?

411
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
No.

412
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,936
I told them we were all going to die
if we don't get south.

413
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,491
Because that's the truth.

414
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:10,175
Shouldn't be long now.

415
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:22,821
What's wrong with him?

416
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,383
He's a warg.

417
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:29,051
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

418
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,545
He's scouting for us.

419
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:33,225
What, you've never met a warg?

420
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,743
Where were you this time?

421
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:03,518
The Fist of the First Men.

422
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:05,316
What did you see?

423
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:12,057
Dead crows.

424
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:25,768
What's the matter, Piggy?
You crying 'cause you're cold?

425
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,926
There's 200 brothers killed by dead men

426
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:34,049
and you're still here...

427
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,301
whimpering.

428
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:39,664
That seem fair to you?

429
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,591
I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting
while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.

430
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,361
Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh?

431
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,921
You know you want to.

432
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,478
Hey.

433
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,844
Get up, Sam.

434
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,014
- No.
- Get up.

435
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:23,102
I can't.

436
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:25,227
If you stop, you'll die.

437
00:29:25,672 --> 00:29:27,389
'Course if you don't stop...

438
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,508
you'll probably die, too.

439
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:32,115
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

440
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:33,782
You left me.

441
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,996
When the white walkers came, you left me.

442
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,370
<i>Aye, we left you.</i>

443
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,529
You're fat and you're slow.

444
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:44,873
We didn't want to die.

445
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:49,219
Help me get him up.

446
00:29:50,097 --> 00:29:51,876
Looks like that piggy is done for.

447
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:54,590
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

448
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,065
- Just get him up!
- Why?

449
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,095
So the rest of us can die?

450
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:02,955
We'll move faster without him.

451
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,608
What is this?

452
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:06,574
Get up, Tarly.

453
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,706
<i>- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.</i>

454
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:14,325
- If he can't, we may as well just go without him.
- That's enough.

455
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:18,577
I forbid you to die.

456
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,536
Do you hear me?

457
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:23,229
- Why should the rest of us...
- Rast...

458
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:25,433
you're responsible for him.

459
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,866
What am I supposed to do?

460
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:30,340
Make sure he gets back alive.

461
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,320
If he doesn't, you don't.

462
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:34,956
Move on!

463
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:44,083
I'm not dying for you, Piggy.

464
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,432
You hear me?

465
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:12,971
Where's Rickon and Hodor?

466
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,887
Looking for food.

467
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,696
What's out there?

468
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,591
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

469
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:14,826
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.

470
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,545
I'm unarmed.

471
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:18,278
That was poor planning.

472
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:21,723
My sister carries the weapons.

473
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:25,088
I'm better with them.

474
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:27,911
Drop the spear.

475
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:32,293
Drop it.

476
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:37,309
If you kill me,

477
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,840
that wolf will tear you to bits.

478
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:47,195
You must be Summer.

479
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,958
I'm Jojen Reed.

480
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,176
This is my sister Meera.

481
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:24,371
We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.

482
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,305
And we have much farther to go.

483
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:33,182
I'm just trying to understand.

484
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,548
- Would you please shut up about it?
- Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.

485
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:40,049
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

486
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,728
He offered to kill any three people you wanted.
Dead.

487
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,279
All you had to do was give him the names.

488
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,523
Anyone.

489
00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:48,463
You could have picked King Joffrey.

490
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:50,112
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

491
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,653
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal,
so why are you complaining?

492
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:55,963
But you could have ended the war.

493
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,226
Where are we going?

494
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,218
North.

495
00:33:58,248 --> 00:34:00,964
If we were going north,
we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.

496
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:03,047
Maybe we already passed it.

497
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:05,010
It's 100 feet wide.

498
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,190
How could we have passed it?

499
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,367
If we hit the Red Fork,

500
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:11,135
we can follow it west to Riverrun.

501
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,639
My mother grew up there.

502
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,783
My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.

503
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,457
Could be a minstrel.
Shut up.

504
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:26,681
A minstrel's got gold sometimes.

505
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:30,512
We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold,
and buy some food.

506
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,409
<i>What's lurking behind that wall?</i>

507
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,974
<i>A lion? A wolf?</i>

508
00:34:56,437 --> 00:34:59,002
<i>Just a dirty little cub, I think.</i>

509
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:01,524
<i>- Loose a few more shafts.
- Don't.</i>

510
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:15,369
Put the sword down, girl.

511
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:20,660
You go on down the road.
Just keep on singing so we know where you are.

512
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:23,468
Leave us be and I won't kill you.

513
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:28,522
Generous.

514
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:30,609
You're a dangerous person.

515
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,672
I like dangerous people.

516
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:38,602
Why are your friends so shy?

517
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:41,918
What friends?

518
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:44,927
The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.

519
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:07,993
Three young ones on the run

520
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:10,455
carrying castle-forged swords.

521
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,972
You escape from Harrenhal?

522
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,002
Who are you?

523
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:15,365
Thoros of Myr.

524
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:17,623
And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.

525
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:19,069
No, who do you fight for?

526
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:20,904
The Brotherhood without Banners.

527
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,372
Now come along.

528
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:29,904
I want to hear how two boys
and a very dangerous girl...

529
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:32,583
escaped Harrenhal.
- I'm not going with them.

530
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:35,862
The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

531
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:37,701
They'll bring us back and put rats in us.

532
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:40,165
You've got nothing to fear from us, son.

533
00:36:40,195 --> 00:36:43,004
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

534
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,834
We're trying to save it.

535
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:46,181
Now come on.

536
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:49,141
We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew.

537
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,971
And then you can go on your way.

538
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:00,921
Here's the thing, fat boy.

539
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:08,432
When I'm done talking,
that arrow's falling down on your fat head.

540
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:12,321
So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.

541
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,180
Half the country's starving and look at this one.

542
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:34,295
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

543
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:43,863
My lion.

544
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:47,398
We've spoken of this.

545
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:51,336
You cannot come here.

546
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:57,381
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

547
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:58,825
Did anyone see you?

548
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,845
- No.
- You sure?

549
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,558
My father does not make idle threats.

550
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:06,784
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

551
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:08,749
You have to be absolutely certain.

552
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,019
All right.

553
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:16,329
What is this problem?

554
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:20,503
I'm worried about Sansa.

555
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:23,071
When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his...

556
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,876
friend warned me about him.

557
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:27,673
Baelish doesn't have friends.

558
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,769
I don't know her name.

559
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:33,885
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

560
00:38:33,915 --> 00:38:38,515
I try to know as many people as I can.
You never know which one you'll need.

561
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,780
She's a whore.

562
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,714
Yes, well, we shouldn't be
judgmental about these things.

563
00:38:42,744 --> 00:38:45,342
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

564
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:49,421
All right, yes, I fucked her once.

565
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:52,706
Twice.

566
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,787
But since I met you, my lady,

567
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:58,903
I've been with no one else.

568
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:04,042
And was she good? Did you like her?

569
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,604
Not as much as I like you, obviously,
or she'd be the one torturing me right now.

570
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:14,286
What did she say about Littlefinger?

571
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,586
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

572
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,722
Is there an idiot in any village
who trusts Littlefinger?

573
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,296
We have to protect her.

574
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,422
We can't.

575
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:32,728
Now that the Lannisters have discarded her,

576
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:34,758
Sansa will have many suitors.

577
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:37,776
A great beauty with a very old name.

578
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:41,111
A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?

579
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:44,049
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

580
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:48,710
Her face is quite pleasing...
to other men and to women,

581
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,222
people in general.

582
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:52,377
But not to me, of course.

583
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,394
I only have eyes for you.

584
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:58,312
You pervert. You want her?

585
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:01,266
This child?
- I don't even want to talk about her.

586
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:04,486
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.

587
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:09,164
I didn't force you to open your mouth
and make words come out.

588
00:40:09,194 --> 00:40:12,878
This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

589
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,873
"Oh, the cruelty.
Shae is so cruel to me. "

590
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,253
Yes.

591
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:32,531
Now do you think I'm cruel?

592
00:40:33,853 --> 00:40:35,333
Only if you stop.

593
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:40,173
But you mustn't come here again.

594
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,524
Do you hear me?

595
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,578
You've come to a dangerous place

596
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,718
full of dangerous people.

597
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:56,461
Dangerous people.

598
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:08,406
<i>Lady Tyrell, my king.</i>

599
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:09,767
Send her in.

600
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,465
You wanted to see me, Your Grace?

601
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:30,387
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.
I...

602
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:33,608
just wanted to make sure
you had everything you need before I left.

603
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:35,927
That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.

604
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:38,762
I have everything I could want.
- Good. Good.

605
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:41,591
How are you finding life in the capital?

606
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:44,274
It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.

607
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,935
A welcome one.

608
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:50,277
A military encampment is no place for a lady.

609
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:52,924
And the bedside of a traitor?

610
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:57,784
Is that a place for a lady?

611
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,047
Your Grace,

612
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:05,036
I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.

613
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:08,486
What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?

614
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:10,922
The duty of any wife to any husband.

615
00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:12,302
To provide him with children.

616
00:42:12,765 --> 00:42:14,701
You failed to do this.

617
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:16,665
- Why?
- I...

618
00:42:20,264 --> 00:42:22,716
I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.

619
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:24,942
You think one ought to speak kindly

620
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,655
of a traitor merely because he's
had a sword put through his heart?

621
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:28,685
No.

622
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:31,440
I do beg your pardon.

623
00:42:32,602 --> 00:42:35,702
The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.

624
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:44,398
I don't believe he was interested
in the company of women.

625
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:48,401
What makes you say this?

626
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,983
Whenever I...

627
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:54,863
wanted to make a child with him,
he...

628
00:42:56,948 --> 00:43:01,152
he had so many excuses,
so many late-night war councils.

629
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,813
He never wanted to try.

630
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,434
Except one evening,

631
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:12,138
after he'd had far too much wine to drink,
he suggested something...

632
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,968
something that sounded...

633
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:22,032
very painful
and couldn't possibly result in children.

634
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,126
Maybe the fault was with me.
- No.

635
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:28,315
He was a known...

636
00:43:29,228 --> 00:43:30,337
degenerate.

637
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:34,311
It's such a relief to hear you say so,
Your Grace.

638
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,898
I've considered making his...

639
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:38,959
perversion punishable by death.

640
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:42,915
As is your right.

641
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,520
You must do whatever you need to do.

642
00:43:52,094 --> 00:43:53,094
You are the king.

643
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:55,235
Yes.

644
00:43:58,686 --> 00:43:59,686
I am.

645
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,309
Do you like it?

646
00:44:08,506 --> 00:44:12,224
I just had it made. Probably one of the finest
weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

647
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,546
It's beautiful.

648
00:44:13,856 --> 00:44:15,574
Will you show me how it works?

649
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,656
It's a new design.

650
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:24,252
Much easier to load. There's no crank.

651
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:25,790
You use this lever...

652
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:27,998
to draw the string.

653
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:35,074
The bolt goes here.

654
00:44:38,006 --> 00:44:39,600
And then you just...

655
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:41,997
aim...

656
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:45,301
and...

657
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,954
Would you take me hunting sometime?

658
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:57,669
Forgive me, Your Grace.
I know a hunt is no place for a woman.

659
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,298
It's not unheard of.

660
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:01,825
My father would never let me before...

661
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:03,847
You no longer belong to him.

662
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:07,038
Do you want to hold it?

663
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:08,257
May I?

664
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:09,395
Please.

665
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,901
I imagine it must be so exciting
to squeeze your finger here

666
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:23,635
and watch something die over there.

667
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:29,525
Could you do it?

668
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,315
Could you...

669
00:45:32,657 --> 00:45:34,274
kill something?

670
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,703
I don't know, Your Grace. Do you think I could?

671
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:39,833
Yes.

672
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,242
Would you like to watch me?

673
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:48,576
Yes.

674
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,440
Stop! Stop!

675
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:55,751
- Tell us the truth.
- About what?

676
00:45:58,195 --> 00:45:59,605
I don't know what you want.

677
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:02,104
I want the truth.

678
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,280
What truth?

679
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:05,937
Why'd you take Winterfell?

680
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:08,432
I took it to...
I took it...

681
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:09,976
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

682
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:11,537
- I took it on my own.
- Why?

683
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,559
To take the North while it was vulnerable.

684
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:16,692
- What were you going to do once you took it?
- Hold it. Rule it.

685
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:17,722
Good.

686
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:19,724
That's very good.

687
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:28,883
- Why did you do that? I told you.
- Why did you take Winterfell?

688
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:32,545
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

689
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:42,045
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

690
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:45,560
I took it because I hated the Starks.

691
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,917
I hated them for holding me prisoner.

692
00:46:47,947 --> 00:46:49,598
I wanted to hurt them.

693
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,833
What are you doing?

694
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:02,913
Please.

695
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:10,845
I'll tell you anything.

696
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,177
Just take it off.

697
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,650
Please. Please, just take it off.

698
00:47:26,232 --> 00:47:28,625
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

699
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:38,526
I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.

700
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,056
No, don't go.

701
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:42,011
Please, please. No, please don't leave me.

702
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:44,284
Please, please.

703
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,993
Please, please don't go!

704
00:47:46,715 --> 00:47:48,645
Please. Please. Don't leave me.

705
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,106
Please don't go.

706
00:47:57,946 --> 00:47:59,533
Rickon, stay with us.

707
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:02,436
It's all right.

708
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,714
The wolves will protect him.

709
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,770
You can get inside his head,

710
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:17,950
see through his eyes.

711
00:48:18,282 --> 00:48:19,459
Only when I'm asleep.

712
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:22,311
That's how it begins until
you learn to control it.

713
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:23,691
You're a warg.

714
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:25,461
It's not just wolves.

715
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:28,839
Sometimes in my dreams there's a...
- A three-eyed raven?

716
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:30,810
You've seen it?

717
00:48:30,899 --> 00:48:32,954
We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

718
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,791
Does it have anything to do with warging?

719
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:38,163
No, the raven is something different,

720
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,046
something deeper.

721
00:48:41,373 --> 00:48:43,004
The raven brings the sight.

722
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,612
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

723
00:48:45,642 --> 00:48:48,299
Or things that happened long before you were born

724
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:51,177
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

725
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,635
What's he telling him?

726
00:48:53,986 --> 00:48:55,400
Why don't you ask?

727
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,724
Isn't he ashamed, your brother,

728
00:48:59,754 --> 00:49:01,341
needing you to protect him?

729
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:03,901
Where's the shame in that?

730
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:07,854
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

731
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:10,558
is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.

732
00:49:12,677 --> 00:49:15,527
Some people will always need help.

733
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:19,445
That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.

734
00:49:22,145 --> 00:49:23,895
When my father died.

735
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:25,736
I dreamt it.

736
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,010
You didn't dream it. You saw it.

737
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:31,126
So did I.

738
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,298
You have the sight, too?

739
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:37,115
When I...

740
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:40,107
told my father about your father...

741
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:44,297
for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.

742
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,247
Your father is Howland Reed?

743
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,540
Yeah.

744
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:49,979
He saved my father's life...

745
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:53,467
during the rebellion.
- Your father told you about the rebellion?

746
00:49:53,497 --> 00:49:55,347
Mine never did.

747
00:49:55,396 --> 00:49:57,146
But I saw that, too.

748
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,329
What else have you seen?

749
00:50:00,776 --> 00:50:03,176
Only one thing that matters.

750
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:04,277
You.

751
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:17,176
<i>I never liked the skinny ones.</i>

752
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:19,306
<i>Like drinking from a puddle.</i>

753
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,368
Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle
every now and again, you understand.

754
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:23,798
I don't drink ale.

755
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:27,259
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

756
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:28,589
You see?

757
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:33,396
They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety.
It's very tedious for all concerned.

758
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:34,426
Now...

759
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:37,785
How did three children...
- We're not children.

760
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:40,189
How did three young persons such as yourselves,

761
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:42,669
untrained in the art of war,

762
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,690
escape from Harrenhal?

763
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:48,688
Gendry's a smith.

764
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:52,454
He was apprenticed in the armory.
- A smith, eh?

765
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:53,919
Where'd you train?

766
00:50:57,248 --> 00:50:59,405
King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

767
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:00,735
That criminal.

768
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:03,427
He charges twice as much
as every other armorer in the city.

769
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:05,807
That's because he's twice as good.

770
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:08,409
A smith and a salesman.

771
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:11,367
Gendry stole us weapons.

772
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:14,486
Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

773
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:16,324
He knows how to use a sword...

774
00:51:16,354 --> 00:51:17,704
and so do I.

775
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,884
My brothers taught me.

776
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,969
To your brothers!

777
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,466
You can finish your meals before you go.

778
00:51:54,496 --> 00:51:56,688
It may be awhile before you see another.

779
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:59,418
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

780
00:52:02,477 --> 00:52:04,327
But before you go,

781
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,667
allow me to raise a cup...

782
00:52:06,697 --> 00:52:07,697
to your...

783
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:12,825
Now that is an uncommonly large person.

784
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:16,286
How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?

785
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:18,837
One waits for him to drink until he passes out.

786
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:19,917
Poor man.

787
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:22,288
You have my sympathy.

788
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,260
Not a man at all.

789
00:52:28,156 --> 00:52:29,356
A Hound!

790
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:33,638
So good to see you again, Clegane.

791
00:52:33,668 --> 00:52:34,668
Thoros?

792
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,432
The fuck you doing here?

793
00:52:38,757 --> 00:52:41,057
Drinking and talking too much.
Same as ever.

794
00:52:42,154 --> 00:52:43,904
A pretty prize, lads.

795
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:48,996
Girl.

796
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:53,007
What in seven hells...

797
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:55,599
are you doing with the Stark bitch?

798
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:08,809
It's a tough decision...

799
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:11,447
Take the bridge and risk being seen

800
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:13,878
or cross the great water.
- Silence, Kingslayer.

801
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:15,818
Anyone can see us on the bridge,

802
00:53:15,848 --> 00:53:18,738
but cross by water and the current could take us

803
00:53:18,768 --> 00:53:22,068
or I could escape down the river.
Good luck.

804
00:53:24,778 --> 00:53:28,478
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

805
00:53:28,726 --> 00:53:30,526
Which will she choose?

806
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:37,620
Gambler at heart.

807
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,116
Wouldn't have guessed.

808
00:53:39,146 --> 00:53:40,446
Be quick about it.

809
00:53:47,906 --> 00:53:49,597
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

810
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:52,500
I have these, you know, on your feet
when you walk too far. What do you call them?

811
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,480
- Get up now.
- Corns.

812
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:56,556
I never used to get corns.

813
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:58,590
Of course I used to ride everywhere,

814
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,745
not march around like a common foot soldier

815
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:03,304
wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

816
00:54:03,334 --> 00:54:06,384
This heel is ruined. There's no way...

817
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:18,429
I never understood why some knights
felt the need to carry two swords.

818
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:39,126
You move well...

819
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:45,225
for a great beast of a woman.

820
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:51,168
You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.

821
00:54:51,198 --> 00:54:52,998
It gives away the game.

822
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,248
Bit of a quandary for you.

823
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:12,478
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

824
00:55:12,845 --> 00:55:14,445
But if you don't kill me,

825
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,514
I'm going to kill you.

826
00:55:23,297 --> 00:55:24,297
You're good.

827
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,914
Graceless, but good.

828
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:40,507
See? If you were willing to hurt me,
you might have had me there.

829
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:26,824
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

830
00:56:26,935 --> 00:56:28,858
if you can call that a woman.

831
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,388
We enjoy a good fight.

832
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:32,618
Gets our juices flowing.

833
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,657
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.

834
00:56:36,177 --> 00:56:37,827
A bit gruesome for my taste.

835
00:56:37,857 --> 00:56:39,307
You sure he's the one?

836
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,438
That's him, all right.

837
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:46,166
I saw him fight at the tourney
for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

838
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:48,725
Give the man his silver.

839
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:54,029
Let us go and my father will
pay you whatever you want.

840
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:56,576
Enough to buy me a new head?

841
00:56:56,838 --> 00:56:59,236
If the King in the North
hears I had the Kingslayer

842
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:02,408
and let him go, he'll be taking it right off.

843
00:57:02,438 --> 00:57:04,087
I'd rather he takes yours.

844
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:18,699
