2
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,425
Summoned to court to answer
for the crimes of your bannermen

3
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,553
Gregor Clegane, the Mountain.

4
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,044
Arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown.

5
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:19,472
Poor Ned Stark.
Brave man, terrible judgment.

6
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,833
Attacking him was stupid.

7
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,744
Lannisters...

8
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,779
don't act like fools.

9
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,417
Are you gonna say something clever?

10
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,870
Go on. Say something clever.

11
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,385
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

12
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,975
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

13
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,307
Ned Stark.

14
00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:08,173
One of our men interfered.

15
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,991
He speared him through the leg
before I could finish him.

16
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,070
Why is he still alive?

17
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:18,077
- It wouldn't have been clean.
- "Clean"!

18
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,331
You spend to much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

19
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,498
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

20
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,668
That's what you want people
to think of you.

21
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,878
It's the truth.

22
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,882
When you hear them whispering
Kingslayer behind your back,

23
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,957
doesn't it bother you?

24
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:41,347
Of course, it bothers me.

25
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,351
The lion doesn't concern himself
with the opinions of a sheep.

26
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,482
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity go in the way

27
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,833
of your recklessness.

28
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:59,490
I'm giving you half of our forces.
30 000 men.

29
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,512
You will bring them
to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home

30
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:07,503
and remind her that Lannisters
pay their debts.

31
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:12,127
I didn't realize you place
such a high value on my brother's life.

32
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,357
He's a Lannister.

33
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:18,098
He might be the lowest
of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.

34
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,816
And every day
that he remains a prisoner,

35
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,490
the less our name commands respect.

36
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:26,475
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinion...

37
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,310
It's not an opinion, it's a fact.

38
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,421
If another house
can seize one of our own,

39
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:36,130
and hold him captive, with impunity,

40
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,362
we are no longer
a house to be feared.

41
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:44,608
Your mother's dead.

42
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:47,161
Before long I'll be dead.

43
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,957
And you, and your brother,

44
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,127
and your sister
and all of her children,

45
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:54,649
all of us dead,

46
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:57,381
all of us rotting in the ground,

47
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,998
It's the family name that lives on.

48
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,025
It's all that lives on.

49
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,601
Not your personal glory,
not your honor, but family.

50
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:10,811
Do you understand?

51
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:26,340
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

52
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,547
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the kingdoms.

53
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,878
And you're still blessed with youth.

54
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,780
And what have you done
with these blessings?

55
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:41,050
You served as a glorified bodyguard
for two kings.

56
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,049
One a mad man.

57
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:44,563
The other a drunk.

58
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:54,188
The future of our family will be
determined in these next few months.

59
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,788
We could establish a dynasty
that would last a thousand years.

60
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,526
Or we could collapse into nothing.

61
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,133
As the Targaryens did.

62
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:07,951
I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

63
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:12,915
Not next year. Not tomorrow.
Now!

64
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:44,863
You're in pain.

65
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:52,996
I've had worse, My Lady.

66
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,898
Perhaps it's time to go home.

67
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,360
The south
doesn't seem to agree with you.

68
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,838
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

69
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,638
Do you, Lord Stark?

70
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:07,379
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

71
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,663
Has he done this before?

72
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,117
Jaime would have killed him.

73
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,629
My brother is worth
a thousand of your friend.

74
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:18,887
Your brother?

75
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:20,566
Or your lover?

76
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:28,406
The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters
for three hundred years,

77
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,526
to keep the bloodlines pure.

78
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:32,956
Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.

79
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:34,618
We shared a womb.

80
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,041
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

81
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:41,003
My son saw you with him.

82
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,183
Do you love your children?

83
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:51,561
- With all my heart.
- No more that I love mine.

84
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:54,308
- And they're all Jaime's.
- Thank the Gods.

85
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:58,090
When Robert leaves his whores
to stumble drunk into my bed,

86
00:07:58,215 --> 00:07:59,897
I finish him off in other ways.

87
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,774
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

88
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,275
Hated him?

89
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,069
I worshiped him.

90
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,238
Every girl in the Seven's Kingdom

91
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,516
dreamed of him,
but he was mine by oath.

92
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,113
And when I finally saw him
on our wedding day

93
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:14,880
in the Sept of Baelor,

94
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,957
lean and fierce and black-bearded,
it was the happiest moment of my life.

95
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:23,141
That night, he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine

96
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,937
and did what he did...
what little he could do.

97
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,093
And whispered in my ear "Lyanna".

98
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,796
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

99
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,758
and he loved her more than me.

100
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:42,212
When the King returns from his hunts,
I'll tell him the truth.

101
00:08:42,337 --> 00:08:43,732
You must be gone by then.

102
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,338
You and your children.

103
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,965
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

104
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,456
Go as far away as you can.

105
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,027
With as many men as you can.

106
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:55,548
Because wherever you go...

107
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:58,121
Robert's wrath will follow you.

108
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,178
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

109
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,238
You should have taken
the realm for yourself.

110
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,338
Jaime told me
about the day King's Landing fell.

111
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:09,333
He was sitting in the Iron Throne,
and you made him give it up.

112
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,718
All you needed to do
was climb those steps yourself.

113
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,703
Such a sad mistake.

114
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:17,188
I've made many mistakes in my life.

115
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:19,768
But that wasn't one of them.

116
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:21,399
Oh, but it was.

117
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,566
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

118
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,059
There is no middle ground.

119
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,749
Is that what they teach you
up in the North?

120
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,502
And you, wherever you're from,

121
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,548
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

122
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,969
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

123
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:38,398
Yes, my Lord.

124
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,141
Let's start over, shall we?

125
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:45,437
You be the man,
and you be the woman.

126
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,736
Well, go ahead!

127
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,447
Slowly.

128
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,421
You're not fooling them.

129
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,672
They just paid you,
they know what you are.

130
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,621
They know it's all just an act.

131
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:16,607
Your job is to make them forget
what they know.

132
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,464
That takes time.

133
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,772
You need to...

134
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,097
ease into it.

135
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,093
Go ahead.

136
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,248
Ease into it.

137
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:42,661
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

138
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,241
You're starting to like this.

139
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,149
He wants to believe you.

140
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,700
He's enjoyed his cock,
why shouldn't you?

141
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,153
He knows he's better than other men.

142
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:58,844
He's always known it deep down inside,
now he has proof.

143
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,820
He's so good,

144
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:05,941
he's reaching something deep inside
of you that no one even knew was there.

145
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,979
Overcoming your very nature.

146
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:13,316
Why don't you join us, my Lord?

147
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:17,002
I'm saving myself for another.

148
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,614
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

149
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,090
A stupid saying.

150
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,870
What we don't know
is usually what gets us killed.

151
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,466
She must be very beautiful.

152
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,252
Not really.
Impeccable bloodlines, though.

153
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,422
- I do believe my Lord's in love.
- For many years.

154
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,218
Most of my life, really.
Play with her ass.

155
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,180
And she loved me too.

156
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,686
I was her little confidant.

157
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,476
Her plaything.
She could tell me anything at all.

158
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:52,940
She told me about all
the horses that she liked.

159
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,607
The castle she wanted to live in.

160
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,817
The man that she wanted to marry.

161
00:12:58,676 --> 00:12:59,826
A Northerner,

162
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:02,408
with a jaw like an anvil.

163
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,954
So I challenged him to a duel, I mean,
why not, I'd read all the stories.

164
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,750
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

165
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:13,613
In the end,

166
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,923
she wouldn't even let him kill me.
"He's just a boy",

167
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,092
she said.

168
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,611
"Please don't hurt him."

169
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,680
So, he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by and off they went.

170
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:27,834
Is she still married to him?

171
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,660
He got himself killed
before the wedding.

172
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:36,483
And she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

173
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,236
She loves him, I'm afraid.

174
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,613
And why wouldn't she?

175
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,573
Who could compare to him?

176
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,242
He's just so...

177
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,582
good.

178
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,786
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

179
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,216
I learned that I'll never win,
not that way.

180
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:04,010
That's their game.

181
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,696
Their rules.

182
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:08,807
I'm not going to fight them.

183
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,102
I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.

184
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:13,939
That's what I am.

185
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:17,656
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

186
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,735
And what do you want?

187
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:23,321
Everything, my dear.

188
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,123
Everything there is.

189
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:30,787
Now wash yourselves,

190
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,706
both of you are working tonight.

191
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,847
You are a very lucky girl,
do you know that?

192
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:12,399
Where I come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

193
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,764
Where I come from, if someone
like you attacked a little Lord,

194
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,700
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back, on the beach,

195
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,545
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

196
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:25,301
Sea would come in closer and closer.

197
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:29,156
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

198
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,208
Where is it you come from?

199
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:34,958
The Iron Islands.

200
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,686
Are they far away?

201
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:39,189
Never heard of the Iron Islands?

202
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,456
Trust me...

203
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:42,859
you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

204
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,528
Trust me, my Lord.

205
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,034
You're not in the wilderness anymore.

206
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:55,683
In civilized lands, you refer
to your betters by their proper titles.

207
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:57,540
And what's that?

208
00:15:58,014 --> 00:15:59,015
Lord.

209
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:00,625
Why?

210
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,087
Why?

211
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,315
What do you mean, why?

212
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,969
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

213
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,595
What's that got to do with you?

214
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,640
If your father's Lord,

215
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,642
how can you be Lord too?

216
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,520
I will be Lord after my father...

217
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,995
- So you're not Lord now.
- No, you...

218
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,826
You're having a go at me?

219
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:26,795
Is that it?

220
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:29,364
Just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

221
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:31,601
I'm not a southerner.

222
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,726
You're from south of the Wall.

223
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:36,673
That makes you a southerner to me.

224
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:41,877
You are an impudent little wench,
aren't you?

225
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,379
Couldn't say, my Lord.

226
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,423
I don't know what "impunent" means.

227
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,676
Impudent.
It means rude,

228
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:51,803
Disrespectful.

229
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,077
Do you want to lose that chain?

230
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,084
Theon Greyjoy!

231
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,108
The lady is our guest.

232
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,110
I thought she was our prisoner.

233
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,821
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

234
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,335
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

235
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,171
I'm used to worse than him.

236
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,157
I'm used to men
who could chew that boy up,

237
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,401
and pick their teeth with his bones.

238
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,268
Why did you come here?

239
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:42,627
Didn't mean to come here.

240
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,356
Meant to get
much further south than this.

241
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,851
As far south, as south goes.

242
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,829
Before the long night comes.

243
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:52,614
Why?

244
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,491
What are you afraid of?

245
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:58,620
There are things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

246
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,291
- Owls and shadow-cats.
- I'm not talking about that.

247
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:09,912
The things you speak of.

248
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:13,619
They've been gone
for thousands of years.

249
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,435
They wasn't gone, old man.

250
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:18,306
They was sleeping.

251
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,501
And they ain't sleeping no more.

252
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,470
I miss girls.

253
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:37,022
Not even talking to them.
I never talk to them.

254
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:40,203
Just looking at them.

255
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,069
Hearing them giggle.

256
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:49,401
Don't you miss girls?

257
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:55,635
Riders!

258
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:57,908
The horn.

259
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,889
We have to blow the horn.

260
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:01,349
Why is he alone?

261
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,829
One blast for a ranger returning.

262
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:08,524
Two for wildlings.

263
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,789
- Three for...
- There's no rider.

264
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,395
That's my uncle Benjen's horse?

265
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:56,574
Where's my uncle?

266
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,163
It's Robert.

267
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,041
We were hunting. A boar.

268
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:18,089
I should have spent
more time with you.

269
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,736
Shown you how to be a man.

270
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:28,333
I was never meant to be a father.

271
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:49,040
Go on.

272
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,543
You don't want to see this.

273
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:08,019
My fault.

274
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,453
Too much wine.

275
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:12,188
Missed my thrust.

276
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,400
It stinks.

277
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,322
It Stinks like death.

278
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,080
Don't think I can't smell it.

279
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:35,641
I paid the bastard back, Ned.

280
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,881
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

281
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,859
You ask them if I didn't. Ask them!

282
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,846
I want the funeral feast to be

283
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,390
the biggest the kingdom ever saw.

284
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,061
And I want everyone to taste
the boar that caught me.

285
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:59,027
Now Leave us, the lot of you,
I need to talk to Ned.

286
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,989
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you.

287
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:24,872
You damned fool.

288
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:27,337
Paper and ink on the table.

289
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,133
Write down what I say.

290
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,847
In the name of Robert,

291
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,918
of the house Baratheon,

292
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,887
First of...

293
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:45,573
you know how it goes,
fill in the damn titles,

294
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,201
I hereby command

295
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,389
Eddard

296
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,592
of House Stark, titles, titles...

297
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:56,501
to serve as a Lord Regent

298
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,516
and Protector of the Realm
upon my death,

299
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,510
to rule in my stead

300
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:06,010
until my son Joffrey comes of age.

301
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:26,030
Give it over.

302
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,641
Give it to the council.

303
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,180
After I'm dead.

304
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,970
At least,
they'll say I did this right.

305
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,938
This one thing.

306
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:53,917
You'll rule now.

307
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,789
You'll hate it worse than I did.

308
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,087
But you'll do it well.

309
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:05,248
The girl.

310
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:07,807
Daenerys.

311
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:10,950
You were right.

312
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:15,464
Varys, Littlefinger,
my brother, worthless.

313
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,224
No one to tell me no, but you.

314
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:21,502
Only you.

315
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,330
Let her live.

316
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:31,262
Stop it, if it's not too late.

317
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:32,573
I will.

318
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,581
My son...

319
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:37,935
help him, Ned.

320
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,314
Make him better than me.

321
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,993
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

322
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:50,070
My memory?

323
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,701
King Robert Baratheon,

324
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:58,831
murdered by a pig.

325
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:05,976
Give me something for the pain,
and let me die.

326
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,912
Give him milk of the poppy.

327
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,107
He was reeling from the wine.

328
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,580
He commanded us to...

329
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,632
step aside, but...

330
00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:41,127
I failed him.

331
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,488
No man could have protected him
from himself.

332
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:49,973
I wonder, Ser Barristan,

333
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:53,615
who gave the King this wine?

334
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:57,265
His squire.
From the King's own skin.

335
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,017
His squire? The Lannister boy?

336
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:02,937
Such a dutiful boy, to make sure

337
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,260
His Grace did not lack
of refreshment.

338
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:08,818
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

339
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:21,122
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

340
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:26,027
Whatever arrangements you made,

341
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,463
unmake them, at once.

342
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:32,883
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

343
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,053
The girl is likely dead already.

344
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:28,715
My...

345
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,206
throne.

346
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:34,878
Throne.

347
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:19,211
Can you help me make him understand?

348
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:22,001
The Dothrakis do things
in their own time for their own reasons.

349
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:23,494
Have patience, Khaleesi.

350
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,636
We will go home, I promise you.

351
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:27,873
My brother was a fool,

352
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,459
I know, but he was
the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

353
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:34,755
- Have I said something funny, sir?
- Forgive me, Khaleesi,

354
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,369
but your ancestor, Aegon the Conqueror,
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms

355
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,636
because they were his right,
he had no right to them,

356
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,716
He seized them because he could.

357
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,181
And because he had dragons.

358
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:47,017
Having a few dragons
makes things easier.

359
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,535
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

360
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:54,666
I believe
what my eyes and ears report.

361
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:59,320
As for the rest, it was 300 years ago,
who knows what really happened?

362
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:01,965
Now if you'll pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain,

363
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,738
see if he has any letters for me.

364
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:06,147
- Well, I come with you.
- No, no, don't trouble yourself.

365
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,475
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

366
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:20,114
Jorah, the Andal.

367
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:24,722
The Spider sends his greetings,

368
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,591
and his congratulations.

369
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:30,561
A royal pardon.

370
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,936
You can go home, now.

371
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,291
My son already has his name,
but I'll try your summerwine.

372
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:16,982
Just a taste.

373
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,842
My Lady, you are from Westeros?

374
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,197
You have the honor of addressing
Daenerys of the House Targaryen.

375
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:27,651
Khaleesi of the riding men
and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

376
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,376
- Princess.
- Rise.

377
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,542
- I'd still like to taste that wine.
- That?

378
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,132
Dornish swill,
not worthy of a princess.

379
00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:40,923
I have a dry red, from the Arbor.

380
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,542
Nectar of the Gods.

381
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,837
Let me give you a cask.

382
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,346
- A gift.
- You honor me, Ser.

383
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,878
The honor is all mine.

384
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:58,548
You know there are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, princess.

385
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,484
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

386
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,034
- Something wrong?
- I have a thirst. Open it.

387
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,038
The wine is for the Khaleesi,
it's not for you.

388
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,290
Open it.

389
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,677
Pour.

390
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:31,098
It would be a crime to drink it
without giving it time to breathe.

391
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,808
Do as he says.

392
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,436
As the princess commands.

393
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,119
Sweet, isn't it?

394
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,202
Can you smell the fruit, Ser?

395
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,580
Taste it.

396
00:31:55,816 --> 00:32:00,016
Tell me that that is not the finest wine
that has ever touched your tongue.

397
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,089
You first.

398
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,763
I'm afraid I am not worthy
of the vintage.

399
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,023
Beside it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.

400
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,101
You will drink.

401
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:49,608
Come.

402
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,443
You came to us as outlaws,

403
00:33:00,048 --> 00:33:01,049
poachers,

404
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:03,983
rapers, killers,

405
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,153
thieves.

406
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:08,562
You came alone, in chains.

407
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:12,401
Without friends nor honor.

408
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:16,754
You came to us rich,
you came to us poor.

409
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:21,534
Some of you
bear the names of proud houses.

410
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,201
Others only bastard names,
or no names at all.

411
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:26,880
It does not matter.

412
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,303
All that...

413
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,008
is in the past.

414
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,171
Here,

415
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,252
on the Wall,

416
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,599
we are all one house.

417
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:40,129
Tonight,

418
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,633
You're allowed to look happy.

419
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:45,346
You're going to be a ranger.

420
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:48,235
Isn't that what you always wanted?

421
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:50,563
I want to find my uncle.

422
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,950
I know he's alive out there,
I know he is.

423
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:59,300
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

424
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,583
It's the steward life, for me.

425
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:05,252
The honor of being a steward.

426
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,529
Not much, really.

427
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:09,600
But there's food...

428
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,065
... and your loves, alike.

429
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,847
Here,

430
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:16,013
you begin a new.

431
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,176
A man

432
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:27,551
of the Night's Watch

433
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:30,527
lives his life

434
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,923
for the realm.

435
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:34,799
Not for a king,

436
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:36,627
or a lord,

437
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:38,987
or the honor of this house

438
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:40,451
or that house,

439
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,343
not for gold and glory

440
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,193
nor a woman's love,

441
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,045
but for the realm,

442
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,176
and all the people in it.

443
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:52,716
You've all learned the words

444
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:54,343
of the vow,

445
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,970
think carefully before you say them.

446
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,307
The penalty for desertion

447
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,604
is death.

448
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,692
You can take your vows here,

449
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,884
tonight,

450
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:13,765
at sunset.

451
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:17,266
Do any of you
still keep the Old Gods?

452
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:20,899
I do, My Lord.

453
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:24,966
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree, as your uncle did?

454
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:26,083
Yes, My Lord.

455
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,994
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall,

456
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,504
and your Old Gods too, maybe.

457
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,053
- Might I go as well?
- Does house Tarly keep the Old Gods?

458
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,261
I was named
in the light of the Seven,

459
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:45,769
as my father was,
and his father before him.

460
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:49,557
Why would you forsake
the gods of your father and your house?

461
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:54,027
The Night's Watch is my house now.

462
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,572
And the Seven
have never answered my prayers.

463
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,795
Perhaps the Old Gods will.

464
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:02,786
As you wish.

465
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:07,226
You've all been assigned an order,

466
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,411
according to our needs

467
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,461
and your strengths.

468
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,463
Halder,

469
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,011
to the builders,

470
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,311
Pyp, to the stewards,

471
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:18,842
Toad, to the builders,

472
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,350
Grenn, to the rangers,

473
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:23,682
Samwell, to the stewards,
Matthar, to the rangers,

474
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,097
Dareon, to the stewards,

475
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:28,312
Balian, to the rangers,

476
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,398
Rast, to the rangers,
Jon, to the stewards,

477
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:33,859
Rancer, to the builder,

478
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,448
Echiel, to the builders,
Gordo, to the stewards,

479
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:38,071
Niko, to the rangers,

480
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,991
Escan, to the rangers,

481
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,784
Vorcoy, to the builders,
Joby, to the stables,

482
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:46,663
Mink, to the kitchens,
Allo, to the builders,

483
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,540
Nelugo, to the rangers.

484
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,634
May all the gods preserve you.

485
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,738
Rangers, with me.

486
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:01,652
Builders.

487
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,407
Samwell.

488
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:25,744
You will assist me
in the rookery and library.

489
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:29,790
You will report to Bowen Marsh
in the kitchens.

490
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:34,139
Report to one-eyed Joe
in the stables.

491
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:38,966
Dareon,
we're sending you to Eastwatch.

492
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,426
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

493
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,968
Make no comment about his nose.

494
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,937
The Lord Commander Mormont
requested you for his personal steward.

495
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:57,192
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals,
and fetch hot water for his bath?

496
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,192
Certainly.

497
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,781
And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

498
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:03,618
change his sheets and blankets daily

499
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:07,244
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

500
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,957
Do you take me for a servant?

501
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:14,584
We took you
for a man of the Night's Watch.

502
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,880
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

503
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,091
- May I go?
- As you wish.

504
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:29,868
Wait.

505
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:32,936
- Don't you see what they're doing?
- I see ser Alliser's revenge.

506
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,855
He wanted it and he got it.

507
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,399
Stewards are nothing but maids.

508
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,568
I'm a better swordsman
than any of you.

509
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:42,550
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

510
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:47,238
I was singing for a high lord
when he put his hand on my leg.

511
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:49,010
And he wanted to see my cock.

512
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,596
I pushed him away and he said
he'd have my hands cut off.

513
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:57,502
Now I'm here, at the end of the world,
with no one to sing for but old man.

514
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:59,440
I'll never see my family again.

515
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:01,313
I'll never be inside a woman again.

516
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,088
So, don't tell me about fair.

517
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:06,780
I thought you were caught steeling
cheese for your starving sister.

518
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,636
I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a lord tried to grab my cock?

519
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,145
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?

520
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,483
I'd like to hear a song.

521
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:23,741
Now listen to me.

522
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:25,072
The old man

523
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,384
is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

524
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,545
You'll be with him day and night.

525
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,100
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

526
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:34,164
But you'll also take his letters,

527
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,740
attend him at meetings,
squire for him in battle.

528
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,252
You'll know everything,

529
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:41,207
be part of everything.

530
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,173
And he asked for you himself.

531
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,052
He wants to groom you for command.

532
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:56,770
I always wanted to be a ranger.

533
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,066
I always wanted to be a wizard.

534
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:05,403
What?

535
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:07,959
I'm serious.

536
00:40:08,084 --> 00:40:10,409
So, you'll stay
and say your words with me.

537
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:20,293
A moment.

538
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:23,505
Alone, if you will.

539
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:35,408
He named you Protector of the Realm.

540
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,071
He did.

541
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,147
She won't care.

542
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,357
Give me an hour
and I put swords at your command.

543
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,611
What should I do with them?

544
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,114
Strike.

545
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,738
Tonight while the castle sleeps.

546
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:53,086
We must get Joffrey away
from his mother and into our custody.

547
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:56,851
Protector of the Realm or no,
who holds the King holds the Kingdom.

548
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:01,210
Every moment you delay
give Cersei another moment to prepare.

549
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,362
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

550
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:05,829
What about Stannis?

551
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,426
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

552
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:12,452
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

553
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:16,183
- Stannis is your older brother.
- This isn't about the succession.

554
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:20,312
That didn't matter
when you rebelled against the Mad King.

555
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,483
What's best for the Kingdoms?

556
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:27,234
What's best for the people we rule?

557
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:31,198
Well, we all know what Stannis is.

558
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:34,319
He inspires no love or loyalty.

559
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:36,286
He's not a King.

560
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:38,955
I am.

561
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:47,631
Stannis is a commander.

562
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:52,802
He has led men into war twice.
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

563
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,555
Yes, he is a good soldier.
So was Robert.

564
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,058
Tell me.

565
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,519
Do you still believe
good soldiers make good kings?

566
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:10,419
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls

567
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,366
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

568
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:28,880
You will sail to Dragonstone.

569
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:32,920
You will place this
in a hand of Stannis Baratheon.

570
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,759
Not his steward.

571
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:38,515
Not his Captain.

572
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,305
And not his wife.

573
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,608
Only Stannis himself.

574
00:42:54,124 --> 00:42:55,240
Now leave us.

575
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:06,042
My Lord Protector.

576
00:43:12,863 --> 00:43:14,718
The King has no true born sons.

577
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,345
Joffrey and Tommen

578
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,264
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

579
00:43:20,615 --> 00:43:22,726
So when the King dies...

580
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,932
The throne passes to his brother.

581
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,147
Lord Stannis.

582
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:29,983
So it would seem.

583
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:34,195
- Unless...
- There is no unless.

584
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,884
He is the rightful hair.
Nothing can change that.

585
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:40,368
He cannot take the throne without you.
You would be wise to deny it to him.

586
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:42,813
And to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

587
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:47,709
Do you have a shred of honor?

588
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:52,589
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

589
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,883
All the power is yours.
You need only...

590
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:57,510
reach out and take it.

591
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,679
Make peace with the Lannisters.

592
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,168
Release the Imp.

593
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,724
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

594
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,228
We've time to get rid of Stannis
and if Joffrey seems likely

595
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,820
to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

596
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:13,568
we simply reveal his little secret
and sit Lord Renly there instead.

597
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,243
We?

598
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:18,319
You'll need someone
to share these burdens, I assure you...

599
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,464
My price would be modest.

600
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:24,400
What you suggest is treason.

601
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:26,539
Only if we lose.

602
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,728
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say.

603
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:35,590
The people
who tried to murder my boy.

604
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:38,009
We only make peace
with our enemies, my Lord.

605
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,429
That's why it's called making peace.

606
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:45,359
I won't do it.

607
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:47,435
So it will be Stannis, and war.

608
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:49,603
There is no other choice.

609
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,093
He is the heir.

610
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:54,859
So why did you call me here?

611
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,828
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

612
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,762
You promised Catelyn you'd help me.

613
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:03,660
The Queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms.

614
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,921
Enough to overwhelm
what remains of my household guard.

615
00:45:07,828 --> 00:45:09,374
I need the gold cloaks.

616
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,870
The City Watch is two thousand strong

617
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,856
and sworn to defend the King's peace.

618
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,111
Look at you.

619
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,680
You know what you want me to do.

620
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,431
You know it has to be done.

621
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:27,937
But it's not honorable, so...

622
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,395
The words stick in your throat.

623
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:35,442
When the Queen proclaims one King,
and the Hand proclaims another,

624
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:38,446
whose peace
do the gold cloaks protect?

625
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:41,586
Who do they follow?

626
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,548
The man who pays them.

627
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:37,336
"Hear my words,
and bear witness to my vow,

628
00:46:38,726 --> 00:46:42,049
"Night gathers,
and now my watch begins.

629
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:44,915
"It shall not end until my death.

630
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:47,309
"I shall take no wife,

631
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:50,725
"hold no lands, father no children.

632
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,062
"I shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

633
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:58,646
"I shall live and die at my post.

634
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,546
"I am the sword in the darkness.

635
00:47:01,972 --> 00:47:04,211
"I am the watcher on the walls.

636
00:47:04,752 --> 00:47:08,091
"I am the shield
that guards the realms of men.

637
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:10,453
"I pledge my life

638
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,674
"and honor to the Night's Watch,

639
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:16,543
"for this night
and all the nights to come."

640
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,151
You knelt as boys,

641
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:20,421
rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

642
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:45,238
What's he got there?

643
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:46,948
To me, Ghost.

644
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,110
Bring it here.

645
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,772
Gods be good!

646
00:47:59,538 --> 00:48:01,288
What will they do to him?

647
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:06,877
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle,

648
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,559
forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

649
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:11,723
And when he falls?

650
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,347
I saw a man last nine miles once.

651
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,690
King Robert still wants me dead.

652
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,984
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

653
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,540
I thought he'd leave me alone,

654
00:48:25,898 --> 00:48:29,219
- now that my brother is gone.
- He will never leave you alone.

655
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:33,187
If you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

656
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:35,747
If you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

657
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,202
his spies would tell him.

658
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,342
He will never abandon the hunt.

659
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,058
You're a Targaryen.

660
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:44,163
The Last Targaryen.

661
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:46,382
Your son will have Targaryen blood

662
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,736
with 40,000 riders behind him.

663
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,305
He will not have my son.

664
00:48:53,492 --> 00:48:55,266
He will not have you either,
Khaleesi.

665
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,836
It's all right.

666
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:03,888
It's all right, let him through.

667
00:52:04,923 --> 00:52:07,458
King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence.

668
00:52:07,984 --> 00:52:09,050
King Joffrey?

669
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,027
King Robert is gone.

670
00:52:11,152 --> 00:52:12,721
The Gods give him rest.

671
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:27,311
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

672
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:28,632
Good.

673
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,740
Is Lord Renly joining us?

674
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:36,320
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

675
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:40,449
He rode through the Old gate
an hour before dawn

676
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,410
with Ser Loras Tyrell

677
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,219
and some 50 retainers.

678
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:46,080
Last seen

679
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,957
galloping South in some haste.

680
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:10,995
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

681
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:21,741
All hail His Grace.

682
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:26,162
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon & Lannister.
The first of his name.

683
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:29,300
King of the Andals and the first men,

684
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:31,542
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

685
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:34,670
and Protector of the Realm,

686
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:56,567
I command the Council to make
all arrangements for my coronation.

687
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,486
I wish to be crowned
within the fortnight.

688
00:53:59,393 --> 00:54:00,279
Today,

689
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,990
I shall accept oaths of fealty
from my loyal councilors.

690
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:09,497
Ser Barristan.

691
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:13,000
I believe no man here
could ever question your honor.

692
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:25,554
King Robert's seal.

693
00:54:26,693 --> 00:54:27,723
Unbroken.

694
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:40,027
Lord Eddard Stark is herein named
Protector of the Realm.

695
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,871
To rule as Regent

696
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:45,989
until the heir come of age.

697
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,787
May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

698
00:54:58,658 --> 00:54:59,922
Protector of the Realm.

699
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:07,054
Is this meant to be your shield,
Lord Stark?

700
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,767
A piece of paper.

701
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,395
Those were the King's words.

702
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,643
We have a new King now.

703
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,944
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke,
you offered me some counsel.

704
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,406
Allow me to return the courtesy.

705
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,195
Bend the knee, my Lord.

706
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:30,077
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son.

707
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:33,998
And we shall allow
you to live out your days

708
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,384
in the grey waste you call "Home".

709
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,128
Your son has no claim to the throne.

710
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,921
Liar!

711
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,798
You condemned yourself
with your mouth.

712
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,342
Seize this traitor.

713
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,097
Ser Barristan is a good man, loyal man.
Do him no harm.

714
00:55:52,897 --> 00:55:54,101
He stands alone?

715
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:59,439
Kill him! Kill all of them!

716
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,525
Commander.

717
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,695
Take the Queen
and her children into custody.

718
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:07,573
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there.

719
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:08,949
Under guard.

720
00:56:09,274 --> 00:56:10,785
Men of the Watch!

721
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,373
I want no bloodshed.

722
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,087
Tell your men to lay down their swords.
No one needs to die.

723
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:25,187
Now!

724
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:39,213
I did warn you not to trust me.

725
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,946
