2
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:10,464
Look at me. Look at me!

3
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,341
Do you remember me now?

4
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:14,760
Remember me?

5
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,345
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,168
You'll be coming with me, boy,

7
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:22,671
and you'll be keeping
your mouth shut.

8
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:42,818
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boy!

9
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,580
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

10
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,621
Do you want to live, boy?!

11
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,423
North, boy, we're going north.

12
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,253
It had three eyes.

13
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,736
It told me to come with him,
so I did.

14
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,733
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

15
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,710
Your father's not down there,
little lord.

16
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,512
Not for many years yet.

17
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,348
You're afraid

18
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,383
Just like Hodor.

19
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:47,269
I'm not afraid of some hole
in the ground.

20
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:50,762
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

21
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,110
I'm a crippled boy
and I'm willing to go.

22
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,573
That's my grandfather Lord Rickard.

23
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:05,264
He was burned alive
by the Mad King Aerys.

24
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,907
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

25
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:11,693
King Robert was
supposed to marry her,

26
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,118
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

27
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,361
Robert started a war to win her back.

28
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,986
He killed Rhaegar,
but she died anyway.

29
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,645
That's where I saw father.

30
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,542
You see?

31
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,397
He's not here.

32
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,294
- Here, Shaggydog.
- Rickon!

33
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:43,956
That beast is supposed
to be chained in the kennels!

34
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,557
He doesn't like chains.

35
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:47,861
What are you doing down here?
Come back up with us.

36
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,457
No, I came to see father.

37
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,181
How many times have I told you?

38
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:55,306
He's in King's Landing
with Sansa and Arya.

39
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:57,631
He was down here. I saw him.

40
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,062
Saw him when?

41
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:00,757
Last night,

42
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,053
when I was sleeping.

43
00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,362
Here, Shaggydog.

44
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,912
You both miss him.

45
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,399
It's only natural he should be
in your thoughts and dreams,

46
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,321
but that doesn't mean that...

47
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,412
You've ruined your sword.

48
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,465
I'll kill them all...

49
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:13,408
Every one of them.

50
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,402
I will kill them all.

51
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,338
My boy.

52
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:24,012
They have your sisters.

53
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:28,588
We have to get the girls back.

54
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:32,728
And then we will kill them all.

55
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,381
<i>The boar's great tusks,
they boded ill</i>

56
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,521
<i>for good King Robert's health</i>

57
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:51,232
<i>and the beast was every bit as fat</i>

58
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,115
<i>as Robert was himself</i>

59
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:59,139
<i>but our brave King cried,
"Do your worst!</i>

60
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:01,415
<i>"I'll have your ugly head!</i>

61
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:06,151
<i>"You're nowhere near as murd'rous as</i>

62
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,296
<i>"the lion in my bed"</i>

63
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:15,322
<i>King Robert lost his battle and</i>

64
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,180
<i>he failed his final test</i>

65
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:25,172
<i>the lion ripped his balls off and...</i>

66
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,365
<i>the boar did all the rest.</i>

67
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,095
Very amusing.

68
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:47,637
Isn't it a funny song?

69
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,156
Thank you for your rendition.

70
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:54,023
I imagine it was even better received
at that tavern.

71
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:58,499
I'm so sorry, Your Grace.
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

72
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:00,457
Tell me, which do you favor:

73
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:03,286
Your fingers or your tongue?

74
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,836
Your Grace?

75
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,466
Fingers or your tongue? If you got
to keep one, which would it be?

76
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,679
Or I could just cut your throat.

77
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,642
Every man needs hands.

78
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,811
Good.

79
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:21,561
Tongue it is.

80
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:25,315
Your Grace, please.
I won't sing... Your Grace.

81
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,810
Ser Ilyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

82
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,535
I beg you! Please no.

83
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,246
Your Grace, please.

84
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,704
I will never sing again!

85
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,421
I'm done for the day.

86
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,293
I'll leave the rest
of the matters to you, mother.

87
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:58,682
You look quite nice.

88
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,459
- Thank you, My Lord.
- "Your Grace."

89
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,254
I'm King now.

90
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,066
Walk with me.

91
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:10,576
I want to show you something.

92
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,210
Do as you're bid, child.

93
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,781
And as soon as you've had your blood,
I'll put a son in you.

94
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,156
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

95
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,135
No, please no!

96
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,746
This one's your father.

97
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,811
This one here.

98
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:43,975
Look at it and see
what happens to traitors.

99
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,771
- You promised to be merciful.
- I was.

100
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,873
I gave him a clean death.

101
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:51,943
Look at him.

102
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:55,155
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear.

103
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,409
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here and obey.

104
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:03,580
Look at him!

105
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:13,528
Well?

106
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,310
How long do I have to look?

107
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,596
As long as it pleases me.

108
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,651
Do you want to see the rest?

109
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,476
If it please Your Grace.

110
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,347
That's your Septa there.

111
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,234
I'll tell you what:

112
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:35,570
I'm going to give you a present.

113
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,697
After I raise my armies

114
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:41,826
and kill your traitor brother,
I'm going to give you his head as well.

115
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,454
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

116
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,646
My mother tells me a King
should never strike his lady.

117
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,049
Ser Meryn.

118
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:18,863
Here, girl.

119
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,263
Will you obey now?

120
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,385
Or do you need another lesson?

121
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,504
I'll look for you in Court.

122
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:39,759
Save yourself some pain, girl.
Give him what he wants.

123
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,514
You'll be needing that again.

124
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:07,829
The proper course is clear:

125
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,826
Pledge fealty to King Renly

126
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:12,425
and move south
to join our forces with his.

127
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,565
Renly is not the King.

128
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,576
You cannot mean
to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.

129
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,593
He put your father to death.

130
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,502
That doesn't make Renly King.

131
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,689
He's Robert's youngest brother.

132
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:28,535
If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell
before me,

133
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,742
Renly can't be King before Stannis.

134
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,563
Declare us for Stannis?

135
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,774
- Renly is not right!
- My Lords.

136
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,738
- If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My Lords!

137
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,500
Here is what I say
to these two Kings.

138
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,953
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

139
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,268
nor Stannis neither.

140
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:52,083
Why should they rule over me and mine

141
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,327
from some flowery seat in the South?

142
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,256
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

143
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,694
Even their Gods are wrong!

144
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,730
Why shouldn't we rule
ourselves again?

145
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,844
It was the Dragons we bowed to

146
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,897
and now the Dragons are dead!

147
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,374
There sits the only King

148
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:20,887
I mean to bend my knee to...

149
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,907
the King in the North!

150
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,493
I'll have peace on those terms.

151
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,045
They can keep their Red Castle

152
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:38,811
and their Iron Chair too.

153
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,800
The King in the North!

154
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:45,378
Am I your brother,

155
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,006
now and always?

156
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,506
Now and always.

157
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,729
My sword is yours,
in victory and defeat

158
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:58,262
from this day until my last day.

159
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,152
The King in the North!

160
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:31,493
I want to see him.

161
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:33,625
Now!

162
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,118
Leave us.

163
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:03,256
You look lovely tonight.

164
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,456
Widowhood becomes you.

165
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,205
Your bed must be lonely.

166
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,575
Is that why you came?

167
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:16,219
I'm not at my best,

168
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,453
but I think I could be of service.

169
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:21,808
Slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

170
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,462
I do like a violent woman.

171
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,794
I will kill you tonight, Ser,

172
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:36,490
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

173
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:37,791
Let me show you how

174
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,500
hit me again, over the ear.

175
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,149
And again and again.

176
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,707
You're stronger than you look.
It shouldn't take long.

177
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,676
That is what you want
the world to believe?

178
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,177
That you don't fear death.

179
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:50,776
But I don't, My Lady.

180
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,765
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

181
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:57,811
Because you are going to the deepest

182
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,020
of the Seven Hells,
if the Gods are just.

183
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,811
What Gods are those?

184
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,442
The trees your husband prayed to?

185
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,239
Where were the trees when his
head was getting chopped off?

186
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,533
If your Gods are real
and if they are just,

187
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,476
why is the world
so full of injustice?

188
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:19,582
Because of men like you.

189
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,437
There are no men like me.

190
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,372
Only me.

191
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:32,887
My son Bran.

192
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,349
How did he come to fall
from that tower?

193
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:37,850
I pushed him out the window.

194
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,855
Why?

195
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:47,443
I hoped the fall would kill him.

196
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:48,612
Why?

197
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,372
You should get some sleep.

198
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,082
It's going to be a long war.

199
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,939
I can't believe
we're actually at war.

200
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:33,529
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

201
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,549
What does it say?

202
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,332
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

203
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,401
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

204
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:47,994
Get back into bed.

205
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,347
They have my son.

206
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,347
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

207
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:07,643
I've heard his wolf killed a doze men
and as many horses.

208
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:09,323
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

209
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,353
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

210
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:14,915
Jaime captured,
his armies scattered...

211
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,470
It's a catastrophe.

212
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,579
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

213
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,119
There's your peace.

214
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,545
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

215
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,945
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

216
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,093
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

217
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:39,034
He's winning
in case you hadn't noticed.

218
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,849
I'm told we still have his sisters.

219
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:44,310
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

220
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,647
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

221
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:50,211
First we must return
to Casterly Rock to raise...

222
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:51,819
They have my son!

223
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,980
Get out, all of you.

224
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,461
Not you.

225
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,104
You were right about Eddard Stark.

226
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:32,859
If he were alive,
we could have used him to broker a peace

227
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,836
with Winterfell and Riverrun,

228
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:38,835
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers.

229
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,965
But now...

230
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:44,162
Madness... madness and stupidity.

231
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:50,292
I always thought
you were a stunted fool.

232
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,783
Perhaps I was wrong.

233
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:55,354
Half wrong.

234
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,286
I'm new to strategy, but...

235
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,171
unless we want to be
surrounded by three armies,

236
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,153
it appears we can't stay here.

237
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:05,786
No one will stay here.

238
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,744
Ser Gregor will head out
with 500 riders

239
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,317
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

240
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,689
The rest of us
will regroup at Harrenhal.

241
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,323
And you will go to King's Landing.

242
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:23,451
And do what?

243
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:24,620
Rule!

244
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,619
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

245
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:32,418
You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.

246
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:36,070
And if you get so much as a whiff
of treason from any of the rest:

247
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,175
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

248
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,162
Why not my Uncle?

249
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,013
Why not anyone? Why me?

250
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,625
You're my son.

251
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,405
Oh, one more thing:

252
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:59,974
You will not take the whore to court.

253
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:02,150
Do you understand?

254
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:28,939
Gently...

255
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,512
Gently...

256
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,016
My son...

257
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:36,607
Where is he?
I want him.

258
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,237
Where is he?

259
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
The boy did not live.

260
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:53,666
Tell me.

261
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,270
What is there to tell?

262
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:57,643
How did my son die?

263
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:01,877
He never lived, My Princess.

264
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:04,100
The women say...

265
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,220
What do the women say?

266
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,654
- They say the child was...
- Monstrous...

267
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:13,422
twisted.

268
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,771
I pulled him out myself.

269
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,984
He was scaled like a lizard,

270
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:21,250
blind,

271
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,878
with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

272
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,608
When I touched him,
the skin fell from his bones.

273
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,534
Inside,

274
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,328
he was full of graveworms.

275
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,693
I warned you
that only death can pay for life.

276
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:40,073
You knew the price.

277
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:42,506
Where is Khal Drogo?

278
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:45,117
Show him to me.

279
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:48,197
Show me what I bought

280
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,282
with my son's life.

281
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:52,756
As you command, lady.

282
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:54,852
Come.

283
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,645
I will take you to him.

284
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:59,697
- Time enough for that later...
- I want to see him now.

285
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:17,319
The Khalasar is gone.

286
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,197
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

287
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,875
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

288
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,781
I'm sorry, My Princess.

289
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:44,548
Why is he out here alone?

290
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:47,175
He seems to like
the warmth, Princess.

291
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,027
He lives.

292
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:56,729
You asked for life,
you paid for life.

293
00:24:56,854 --> 00:24:59,341
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

294
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,419
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east

295
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:04,837
when the seas go dry.

296
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,175
When the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

297
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:25,025
Leave us.

298
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:28,821
I don't want you alone
with this sorceress.

299
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:31,925
I have nothing more
to fear from this woman.

300
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:34,493
Go.

301
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,145
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

302
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:47,006
It was wrong of them
to burn my temple.

303
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:50,634
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

304
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:53,112
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

305
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,056
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

306
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,460
Now he will burn no cities.

307
00:25:58,585 --> 00:26:01,062
Now his Khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

308
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,223
I spoke for you.

309
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,662
I saved you.

310
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:06,984
Saved me?

311
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:10,988
Three of those riders
had already raped me

312
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,061
before you saved me, girl.

313
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,870
I saw my God's house burn,

314
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,214
there where I had healed men
and women beyond counting.

315
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,086
In the streets
I saw piles of heads...

316
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:28,593
the head of the Baker
who makes my bread,

317
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,312
the head of a young boy

318
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:33,073
that I had cured of fever
just three moons past.

319
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:38,307
So tell me again exactly
what it was that you saved.

320
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:40,226
Your life.

321
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,772
Why don't you
take a look at your Khal...

322
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,692
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth

323
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:51,817
when all the rest has gone.

324
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,536
You can't!

325
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:09,788
Get out of my way, Sam.

326
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:11,437
They'll put out the word.

327
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,909
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

328
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,696
Do you know
what happens to deserters?

329
00:27:20,711 --> 00:27:21,934
Better than you do.

330
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,028
What are you going to do?

331
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,664
I'm gonna find my brother

332
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,608
and put a sword
through King Joffrey's throat.

333
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:32,969
You can't leave us now.

334
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:34,633
We need you here.

335
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:36,315
Move.

336
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,325
I won't let you go.

337
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:39,944
Move.

338
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:00,913
Hand of the King?

339
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,349
So it would seem.

340
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:08,301
And your father said you couldn't take
anyone with you to King's Landing.

341
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:11,692
He said I couldn't take you
with me to King's Landing.

342
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,505
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

343
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,780
What?

344
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:19,366
He said, "Don't bring Shae
with you to King's Landing"?

345
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,234
I believe he used the word "whore."

346
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:25,575
Are you ashamed of me?

347
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:29,215
Are you afraid that I'm dancing
around the court with my tits out?

348
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:31,707
I'm funny now?

349
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,932
I'm Shae the funny whore.

350
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,004
My father's probably
the most powerful man in the country.

351
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:39,262
Certainly the richest.

352
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,431
He has all Seven Kingdoms
in his pockets.

353
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,418
Everyone everywhere

354
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:47,378
always has to do exactly
what my father says.

355
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:50,731
He's always been a cunt.

356
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,615
I believe the ladies of the court

357
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:02,553
could learn a great deal
from a girl like you.

358
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:06,622
Why don't you come with me,

359
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:08,789
be the Hand's lady?

360
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,339
Because the King needs
a Hand and the Hand...

361
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,176
I know what a Hand needs.

362
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,181
Ghost?

363
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:53,164
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

364
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,539
Did we get him?

365
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,631
Help me get him up.

366
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,814
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

367
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:07,516
- We take you back where you belong.
- I belong with my brother.

368
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:10,649
- We're your brothers now.
- They'll kill you if they find out.

369
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,136
They'll kill you
if they know you came after me.

370
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,531
Go back.

371
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,392
Sam told us everything.

372
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,429
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

373
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,449
You took the oath, you can't leave.

374
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,579
- I have to.
- You can't.

375
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:26,994
- You said the words.
- I don't care...

376
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,496
"Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow..."

377
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,598
To hell with all of you.

378
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,792
"Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

379
00:30:34,692 --> 00:30:36,759
"It shall not end until my death.

380
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:39,214
"I shall live and die at my post."

381
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,924
"I am the sword in the darkness,"

382
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:42,857
"the watcher on the walls,

383
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:45,478
"the shield that guards
the realms of men.

384
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:49,202
"I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

385
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,836
"for this night
and all nights to come."

386
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,288
When the sun

387
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:40,805
rises in the west

388
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:44,706
and sets in the east...

389
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:52,349
then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

390
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:00,595
Kings?

391
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:05,382
I can tell you
all there is to know about Kings.

392
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:10,990
The thing you need
to understand about Kings is...

393
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:17,777
For the past 67 years,

394
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:20,999
I've known, truly known,

395
00:34:21,432 --> 00:34:24,128
more Kings than any man alive.

396
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:28,212
They're complicated men,

397
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:30,583
but I know how to serve them.

398
00:34:32,814 --> 00:34:34,580
And keep on serving them.

399
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,351
Aerys Targaryen...

400
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:45,894
of all the thousand maladies
the Gods visit on us,

401
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,022
madness is the worst.

402
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:52,254
He was a good man,

403
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:54,996
such a charmer.

404
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:59,267
To watch him melt away
before my eyes,

405
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,310
consumed by dreams

406
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,534
of fire and blood...

407
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:11,554
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal.

408
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,160
A powerful man,

409
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,635
a great warrior,

410
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:18,186
but alas, winning a Kingdom

411
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:22,291
and ruling a Kingdom
are rather different things.

412
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,416
They say that

413
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,855
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

414
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,540
he can often be blind

415
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:32,881
to the enemies at his side.

416
00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:37,222
Now I serve his son

417
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:40,212
King Joffrey,

418
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,433
may the Gods bless his reign.

419
00:35:44,814 --> 00:35:48,517
He is a capable young man,
strong military mind.

420
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,451
Stern...

421
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,411
But sternness in defense of the realm
is no vice.

422
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:00,805
It's far too soon to know
what manner of King he will be,

423
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:02,247
but I sense

424
00:36:03,116 --> 00:36:07,085
true greatness on the horizon
for our new King.

425
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:10,576
True greatness.

426
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:17,846
So what's the thing?

427
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,009
What thing?

428
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:22,701
About Kings.

429
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:26,443
You said, "the thing you need
to understand about Kings..."

430
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:29,149
Things?
What?

431
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:30,767
When you started...

432
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,391
never mind.

433
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,877
Let me see you out, my dear.

434
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:37,830
It's all right.
No need.

435
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:41,271
Till the next time.

436
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:32,951
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

437
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:34,955
Does the crown fit?

438
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:39,916
Do lords and ladies simper and bow,
the ones who sneered at you for years?

439
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:44,595
It's hard for them
to simper and bow without heads.

440
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:48,163
A man with great ambition
and no morals,

441
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:49,972
I wouldn't bet against you.

442
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:54,443
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself up there?

443
00:37:56,876 --> 00:38:00,293
I must be one of the few men
who doesn't want to be King.

444
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:03,816
You must be one of the few men
who isn't a man.

445
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:05,370
You can do better than that.

446
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:13,501
When they castrated you,
they took the pillar with the stones?

447
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:15,507
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

448
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:18,133
You spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

449
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,815
I picture a gash

450
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:23,826
like a woman's.
Is that about right?

451
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:26,645
I am flattered, of course,
to be pictured at all.

452
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,584
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

453
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,653
a man from another land,

454
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,711
despised by most,

455
00:38:36,229 --> 00:38:37,441
feared by all.

456
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,154
Am I?
That is good to know.

457
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:42,567
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

458
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,686
But you carry on,

459
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:47,037
whispering in one King's ear
and then the next.

460
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:53,001
I admire you.

461
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:55,558
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

462
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:58,945
A grasper from a minor house
with a major talent

463
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,926
for befriending powerful men...

464
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,307
and women.

465
00:39:02,846 --> 00:39:04,943
A useful talent,
I'm sure you'd agree.

466
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:10,156
So here we stand...

467
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:13,191
in mutual admiration and respect.

468
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:15,273
Playing our roles.

469
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,733
Serving a new King.

470
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,750
Long may he reign.

471
00:39:19,362 --> 00:39:21,150
- My King.
- My King.

472
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:23,724
My Lords.

473
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,047
Shall we begin?

474
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,745
You're Arry now, hear me?

475
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:30,413
Arry the orphan boy.

476
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,359
No one asks an orphan
too many questions

477
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:35,584
'cause nobody gives three shits.

478
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,284
What's your name?

479
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:42,514
We have a long way to travel
and in bad company.

480
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:46,680
I have 20 this time,
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

481
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:50,227
Your Lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons

482
00:39:50,352 --> 00:39:53,287
and I didn't find
no little lordlings down there.

483
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:54,875
This lot,

484
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,620
half of them would turn you over
quick as spit for a pardon.

485
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,175
And the other half would do the same,

486
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,271
except they'd rape you first.

487
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,509
So keep to yourself, and when you piss,
do it in the woods alone.

488
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,619
You stay with this lot, boy.

489
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,206
And stay...

490
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:17,085
or I'll lock you in the back
of the wagon with these three.

491
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:22,549
Watch yourself.

492
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,136
He's got a sword.

493
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,680
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

494
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:31,433
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire.

495
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,383
Look at him. He looks like a girl.

496
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:35,185
I bet he stole that sword.

497
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,106
Let's have a look.

498
00:40:40,753 --> 00:40:43,643
- I could use me a sword like that.
- Take it off him.

499
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:46,114
- Give it here, midget.
- Look at him!

500
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:50,035
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

501
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:53,205
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

502
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:54,675
until he was dead.

503
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,458
I kicked him all to pieces.

504
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,254
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

505
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:03,048
I'll give it to you.

506
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,759
I already killed one fat boy.

507
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:09,763
I bet you never killed anyone.
I bet you're a liar.

508
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,454
But I'm not.

509
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:15,185
I'm good at killing fat boys.
I like killing fat boys.

510
00:41:17,193 --> 00:41:19,022
You like picking on the little ones,
do you?

511
00:41:19,745 --> 00:41:21,900
I've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

512
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:25,987
When I hit that steel, it sings.
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

513
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:35,792
This is castle-forged steel.

514
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,897
Where'd you steal it?

515
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,543
It was a gift.

516
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:41,224
It don't matter now.

517
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,710
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

518
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:48,635
They've got rapers, pickpockets,
highwaymen, murderers.

519
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:50,220
Which are you?

520
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,305
Armorer's apprentice.

521
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:56,143
But my master got sick of me, so...

522
00:41:56,495 --> 00:41:57,290
here I am.

523
00:41:57,415 --> 00:42:00,564
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

524
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,318
It's a thousand leagues
from here to the Wall

525
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:06,201
and winter is coming!

526
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,503
Ham.

527
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:43,148
How many days in a row must a man be
expected to start his day with ham?

528
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,942
Bring me some beer at least.

529
00:42:49,238 --> 00:42:50,741
You look exhausted.

530
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,502
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

531
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:57,996
Don't look so terrified.

532
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:01,513
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

533
00:43:01,638 --> 00:43:03,084
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

534
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:07,824
At least you weren't whoring
in Mole's Town.

535
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:12,302
Honor made you leave,
honor brought you back.

536
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,290
My friends brought me back.

537
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,433
I didn't say it was your honor.

538
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,020
- They killed my father.
- You'll bring him back to life?

539
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:25,781
No? Good.

540
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:28,146
We've had enough
of that sort of thing.

541
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:32,948
Beyond the Wall, the rangers
are reporting whole villages abandoned.

542
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,369
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

543
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:39,043
from dusk until dawn.

544
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:41,373
A captured Wildling swears

545
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:44,209
their tribes are uniting
in some secret stronghold,

546
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,754
to what ends, the Gods only know.

547
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:50,090
Outside Eastwatch

548
00:43:50,258 --> 00:43:53,593
Cotter Pyke's men
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

549
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:57,722
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

550
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:04,145
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

551
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:11,820
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

552
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:15,423
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

553
00:44:17,326 --> 00:44:18,327
Good.

554
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,708
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

555
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,429
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

556
00:44:25,734 --> 00:44:26,938
Beyond the Wall?

557
00:44:27,587 --> 00:44:30,505
I'll not sit meekly by
and wait for the snows.

558
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:33,439
I mean to find out what's happening.

559
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,576
The Night's Watch will ride in force

560
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:40,933
against the Wildlings, the White Walkers
and whatever else is out there.

561
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:47,904
And we will find Benjen Stark,
alive or dead.

562
00:44:49,609 --> 00:44:51,320
I will command them myself.

563
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,154
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow.

564
00:44:56,806 --> 00:44:59,169
Are you a brother
of the Night's Watch

565
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:03,121
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

566
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:49,495
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

567
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,656
Sell them.

568
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,588
You can return to the Free Cities
and live as a wealthy woman

569
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:55,924
- for all your days.
- They were not given to me to sell.

570
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,307
Khaleesi,

571
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:05,501
My Queen,

572
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,844
I vow to serve you, obey you,

573
00:46:09,237 --> 00:46:10,918
to die for you if need be,

574
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,400
but let him go, Khaleesi.

575
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:16,820
I know what you intend. Do not.

576
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:18,542
I must.

577
00:46:20,732 --> 00:46:23,201
- You don't understand...
- Don't ask me to stand aside

578
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:25,342
as you climb on that pyre.

579
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:27,705
I won't watch you burn.

580
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,123
Is that what you fear?

581
00:46:50,718 --> 00:46:52,791
You will be my Khalasar.

582
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,016
I see the faces of slaves.

583
00:46:58,165 --> 00:46:59,522
I free you.

584
00:47:00,558 --> 00:47:04,218
Take off your collars.
Go if yo wish, no one will stop you.

585
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:06,264
But if you stay,

586
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:10,514
it will be as brothers and sisters,

587
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,169
as husbands and wives.

588
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:27,417
Ser Jorah, bind this woman
to the pyre.

589
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:31,780
You swore to obey me.

590
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:44,077
I am Daenerys Stormborn

591
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:48,453
of House Targaryen
of the blood of Old Valyria.

592
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,886
I am the Dragon's daughter.

593
00:47:52,011 --> 00:47:53,691
And I swear to you

594
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:58,463
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

595
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:01,591
- You will not hear me scream.
- I will.

596
00:48:03,794 --> 00:48:05,773
But it is not your screams I want.

597
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,544
Only your life.

598
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:41,022
Blood of my blood.

599
00:51:28,173 --> 00:51:30,785
