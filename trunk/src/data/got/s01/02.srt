2
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,617
You need to drink, child.

3
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:18,784
And eat.

4
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:25,389
Isn't there anything else?

5
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,537
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance:

6
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:30,901
Grass and horses.

7
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,460
People can't live on grass.

8
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:45,019
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,

9
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:48,668
they say there are fields of ghost grass
with stalks as pale as milk

10
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,486
that glow in the night.

11
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:52,827
It murders all other grass.

12
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:55,943
The Dothraki believe that one day

13
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,845
it will cover everything.
That's the way the world will end.

14
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:13,902
It'll get easier.

15
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,366
Khaleesi!

16
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,714
Your hands.

17
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,870
We're still not far from Pentos,
your Grace.

18
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,687
Magister Illyrio
has extended his hospitality.

19
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:13,379
You'd be more comfortable there.

20
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,347
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

21
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:18,346
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

22
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,957
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

23
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:22,782
As you wish, your Grace.

24
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,349
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

25
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,068
I suppose it is preferable
to beheading.

26
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,483
What did Ned Stark want you for?

27
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,258
Buying from a slaver?

28
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:37,398
Selling to one...

29
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,654
some poachers I caught on my land.

30
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,160
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

31
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,396
You can rest assured of that.

32
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:15,374
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

33
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,390
My mother's been looking for you.

34
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,490
We ride for King's Landing today.

35
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,852
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

36
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,749
and offer your sympathies.

37
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,539
What good will
my sympathies do them?

38
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:34,334
None.

39
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,381
But it is expected of you.
Your absence has already been noted.

40
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,561
The boy means nothing to me.

41
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,899
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

42
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,098
One word and I'll hit you again.

43
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,994
I'm telling mother!

44
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,018
Go!

45
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:52,415
Tell her.

46
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,737
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

47
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:57,440
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them and tell them

48
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,442
how very sorry you are,

49
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,279
and that all your prayers are
with them. Do you understand?

50
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,142
You can't...

51
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,533
Do you understand?

52
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,668
The prince will remember that,
little lord.

53
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:17,104
I hope so.

54
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,809
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

55
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,170
Time for breakfast.

56
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,823
Bread. And two of those little fish.

57
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,879
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

58
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,426
And bacon, burned black.

59
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:50,243
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

60
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,624
Is Bran going to die?

61
00:06:58,643 --> 00:06:59,586
Apparently not.

62
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:04,621
What do you mean?

63
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,418
The Maester says the boy may live.

64
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:17,658
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

65
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:19,440
Only the gods know for certain.

66
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,808
All the rest of us can do is pray.

67
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,986
The charms of the north

68
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:28,077
- seem entirely lost on you.
- I still can't believe you're going.

69
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,828
- It's ridiculous even for you.
- Where's your sense of wonder?

70
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,078
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

71
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,647
the wintry abode
of the White Walkers.

72
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,588
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

73
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,371
And go celibate?

74
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,175
The whores would go begging from Dorne
to Casterly Rock.

75
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:50,638
I just want to stand on top of the wall
and piss off the edge of the world.

76
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,974
The children don't need
to hear your filth.

77
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:57,823
Come.

78
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,029
Even if the boy lives,

79
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:08,322
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

80
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,884
Give me a good clean death any day.

81
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:15,789
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

82
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:19,262
Death is so final, whereas life...

83
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:20,835
Life is full of possibilities.

84
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:23,776
I hope the boy does wake.

85
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:26,951
I'd be very interested
to hear what he has to say.

86
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:30,846
My dear brother,

87
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:33,764
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

88
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,933
My dear brother, you wound me.

89
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,796
You know how much I love my family.

90
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,165
Please.

91
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,585
I would have dressed, your Grace.

92
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,921
This is your home. I'm your guest.

93
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,078
Handsome one, isn't he?

94
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:12,261
I lost my first boy,

95
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,371
a little black-haired beauty.

96
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,646
He was a fighter too...

97
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,844
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

98
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:23,159
Forgive me.

99
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:26,567
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

100
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,842
I never knew.

101
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,784
It was years ago.

102
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,629
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

103
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:38,536
all the things men do to show you
how much they care.

104
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,419
The boy looked just like him.

105
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,110
Such a little thing...

106
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,161
A bird without feathers.

107
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:57,301
They came to take his body away

108
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,479
and Robert held me. I screamed
and I battled, but he held me.

109
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,151
That little bundle.

110
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,602
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

111
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,027
Never have visited the crypt, never.

112
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:28,690
I pray to the mother
every morning and night

113
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,715
that she return your child to you.

114
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:34,551
I am grateful.

115
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,637
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

116
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,531
A sword for the wall?

117
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:33,987
I already have one.

118
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:37,115
Good man.
Have you swung it yet?

119
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,700
Of course I have.

120
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,242
At someone, I mean.

121
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:48,341
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

122
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,032
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

123
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,340
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

124
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,513
Let me thank you ahead of time
for guarding us all from the perils

125
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,930
beyond the wall...

126
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,476
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

127
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,690
We're grateful to have good,
strong men like you protecting us.

128
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:16,008
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

129
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,201
Is it "we" already?

130
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:25,663
- Have you taken your vows then?
- Soon enough.

131
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:32,045
Give my regards to The Night's Watch.
I'm sure it will be thrilling

132
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,506
to serve in such an elite force.
And if not?

133
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,670
It's only for life.

134
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:59,037
Thank you, Nymeria.

135
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,049
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

136
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,881
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

137
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,088
Who cares how they're folded?!
They're going to get all messed up.

138
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:17,382
It's good you've got help.

139
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,549
Watch.

140
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,052
Nymeria, gloves.

141
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,268
Impressive.

142
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:29,435
Shut up.

143
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:30,936
Nymeria,

144
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,104
gloves!

145
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:35,608
I have something for you.

146
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:38,153
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

147
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:39,987
A present?

148
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,404
Close the door.

149
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,753
This is no toy.

150
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,343
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

151
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,514
It's so skinny.

152
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,714
So are you.

153
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:10,602
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

154
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,396
It won't hack a man's head off,
but it can poke him full of holes

155
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,107
- if you're quick.
- I can be.

156
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,573
You'll have to work at it every day.

157
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:19,610
How does it feel?

158
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,440
Do you like the balance?

159
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:24,206
I think so.

160
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,328
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

161
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:30,245
I know which end to use.

162
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,836
I'm going to miss you.

163
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,797
Careful.

164
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,938
All the best swords
have names, you know.

165
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,630
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

166
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:03,905
I've got a needle of my own.

167
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:20,879
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

168
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:22,549
You've said it.

169
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:36,607
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

170
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,942
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

171
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:43,569
I'm taking the black.

172
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:55,414
I know we always talked about
seeing the wall together,

173
00:15:56,075 --> 00:16:00,175
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

174
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,290
I'll know my way around by then.

175
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:06,837
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

176
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:15,112
We can go out walking beyond
the wall, if you're not afraid.

177
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,744
I want you to leave.

178
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:37,278
17 years ago you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

179
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,185
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

180
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,033
And now you're leaving again.

181
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,569
I have no choice.

182
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,714
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

183
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:59,080
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

184
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,896
You do have a choice.

185
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:05,794
And you've made it.

186
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,730
I can't do it, Ned.

187
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:23,943
I really can't.

188
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:25,564
You can.

189
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,611
You must.

190
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:55,424
You've said goodbye to Bran?

191
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:58,203
He's not going to die. I know it.

192
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:00,228
You Starks are hard to kill.

193
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,683
My mother?

194
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,605
She was very kind.

195
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:05,962
Good.

196
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,651
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

197
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,165
It was always my color.

198
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,866
Farewell, Snow.

199
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,422
And you, Stark.

200
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,328
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

201
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,539
The Starks have manned the wall
for thousands of years.

202
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,679
And you are a Stark.

203
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:23,975
You might not have my name,
but you have my blood.

204
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,166
Is my mother alive?

205
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:36,109
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

206
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,235
Does she care?

207
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,754
The next time we see each other,

208
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,451
we'll talk about your mother.

209
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,176
I promise.

210
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:32,014
Gods, this is country!

211
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,736
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

212
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:41,803
I've half a mind to go with you.

213
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:46,881
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

214
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:50,389
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

215
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,982
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

216
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,859
There were wars to fight,
women to marry...

217
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:59,988
- we never had the chance to be young.
- I recall a few chances.

218
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,537
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

219
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:09,123
That common girl of yours? Becca?

220
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,459
With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

221
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:13,794
Bessie. She was one of yours.

222
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:17,361
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie

223
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:18,955
and her tits.

224
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,761
Yours was... Aleena?

225
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:26,087
No. You told me once. Meryl?

226
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,356
Your bastard's mother?

227
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:32,101
- Wylla.
- That's it.

228
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:36,810
She must have been a rare wench to make
Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.

229
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,152
You never told me
what she looked like.

230
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:41,404
Nor will I.

231
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,402
We were at war.

232
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,652
None of us knew
if we were gonna go back home again.

233
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:51,957
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

234
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:57,212
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

235
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,174
The worst thing
about your coronation...

236
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,631
I'll never get to hit you again.

237
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:07,297
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

238
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:13,407
There was a rider in the night.

239
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:23,175
Daenerys Targaryen
has wed some Dothraki horselord.

240
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,156
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

241
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,918
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one,

242
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:29,703
and a bold man to wield it.

243
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:31,400
She's little more than a child.

244
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:35,000
Soon enough that child
will spread her legs and start breeding.

245
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,753
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

246
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:42,323
What her father did to your family...
that was unspeakable.

247
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,634
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister...

248
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,547
the woman I loved.

249
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,038
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

250
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,178
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

251
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:53,573
This Khal Drogo,

252
00:23:54,874 --> 00:23:56,688
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

253
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:59,709
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

254
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:02,347
as long as they remain
on the other side of the Narrow Sea.

255
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:04,362
They have no ships, Robert.

256
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,365
There are still those in the Seven
Kingdoms who call me usurper.

257
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,280
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

258
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:13,830
the scum will join him.

259
00:24:13,998 --> 00:24:15,340
He will not cross.

260
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:19,608
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

261
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:26,926
There's a war coming, Ned.

262
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,682
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

263
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:32,766
but it's coming.

264
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:45,631
Sit.

265
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:47,949
You'll be fed.

266
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:53,806
Untie them.

267
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,642
Rapers.

268
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:03,648
They were given a choice no doubt...
castration or the Wall.

269
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,942
Most choose the knife.

270
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,357
Not impressed by your new brothers?

271
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,329
Lovely thing about the Watch...

272
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:21,816
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

273
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:32,677
Why do you read so much?

274
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:35,305
Look at me and tell me what you see.

275
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:38,474
Is this a trick?

276
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:42,258
What you see is a dwarf.

277
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,301
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

278
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:49,724
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

279
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,225
Things are expected of me.

280
00:26:52,837 --> 00:26:55,116
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

281
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,202
Until your brother killed that King.

282
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,831
Until my brother killed him.

283
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:11,173
Life is full of these little ironies.

284
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:13,927
My sister married the new King

285
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:17,773
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

286
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:23,861
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

287
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,825
But how?

288
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,908
Well, my brother has his sword

289
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,633
and I have my mind.

290
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,829
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

291
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,283
That's why I read so much.

292
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:43,844
And you?

293
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:46,626
What's your story, bastard?

294
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,732
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

295
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:58,721
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

296
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:00,975
off to join

297
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,184
the ancient order
of The Night's Watch,

298
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:07,188
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

299
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:09,309
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

300
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:12,577
Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks

301
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:16,030
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

302
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:18,295
You're a smart boy.

303
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:20,552
You don't believe that nonsense.

304
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:31,407
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

305
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,974
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

306
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,670
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

307
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,270
Talk to Poole about it.

308
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,369
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

309
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:25,350
We need a new steward,

310
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:28,499
and there are several other appointments
that require

311
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,147
- our immediate attention...
- I don't care about appointments!

312
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:35,735
I'll make the appointments.

313
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,573
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

314
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,241
Very good, my Lord.

315
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,105
My Lady.

316
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:02,010
When was the last time
you left this room?

317
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,251
- I have to take care of him.
- He's not going to die, mother.

318
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:08,027
The most dangerous time has passed.

319
00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:09,227
What if he's wrong?

320
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:12,579
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

321
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:15,067
He's six.

322
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,933
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

323
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:21,335
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

324
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,574
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

325
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:28,830
Fire.

326
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:32,166
You stay here. I'll come back.

327
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:51,853
You're not supposed to be here.

328
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,314
No one is supposed to be here.

329
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:56,816
It's a mercy.

330
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,179
He's dead already.

331
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:02,155
No!

332
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:11,938
Have you ever seen a dragon?

333
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:13,726
Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

334
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,771
Everywhere? Even in the east?

335
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:18,197
No dragon.

336
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:19,815
Brave men kill them.

337
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,534
- It is known.
- It is known.

338
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:26,948
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

339
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:28,282
The moon?

340
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:31,570
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

341
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:34,664
that once
there were two moons in the sky.

342
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:38,916
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat.

343
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,763
Out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

344
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,818
and they drank the sun's fire.

345
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:46,668
Moon is no egg.

346
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,470
Moon is goddess... wife of sun.

347
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,993
- It is known.
- It is known.

348
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,679
Leave me with her.

349
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,112
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

350
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:10,167
Men like to talk when they're happy.

351
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:14,211
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

352
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:16,247
How old were you?

353
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,619
I was nine when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

354
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:20,745
Nine?!

355
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:24,605
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

356
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:26,499
First

357
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:28,134
you must learn.

358
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,473
Can you teach me
how to make the Khal happy?

359
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,520
Will it take three years?

360
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:05,522
Welcome.

361
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:39,991
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

362
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:44,510
I don't think
Bran fell from that tower.

363
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:47,608
I think he was thrown.

364
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:51,840
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

365
00:35:51,965 --> 00:35:54,157
Someone tried to kill him twice.

366
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:57,744
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

367
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:00,496
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

368
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:02,165
Saw what, my lady?

369
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,655
I don't know.

370
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:07,086
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

371
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,506
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

372
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,427
Did you notice the dagger?
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

373
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:18,639
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

374
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,491
Someone gave it to him.

375
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:23,770
They come into our home

376
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:25,605
and try to murder my brother?

377
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,484
- If it's war they want...
- You know I'll stand behind you.

378
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:31,819
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

379
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,450
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

380
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:39,494
We don't know the truth yet.

381
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:42,038
Lord Stark must be told of this.

382
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:44,989
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

383
00:36:45,114 --> 00:36:46,959
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

384
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:48,920
There must always
be a Stark in Winterfell.

385
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:51,379
I will go myself.

386
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:53,368
- Mother, you can't.
- I must.

387
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:57,630
I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen
to escort you.

388
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:00,273
Too large a party
attracts unwanted attention.

389
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:02,502
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

390
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:04,018
Let me accompany you at least.

391
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,063
The Kingsroad can be
a dangerous place for a woman alone.

392
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:12,707
What about Bran?

393
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:17,782
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

394
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,262
Bran's life

395
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:22,483
is in their hands now.

396
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,088
No, Khaleesi.

397
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,803
You must look in his eyes always.

398
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:28,394
Love comes in at the eyes.

399
00:38:30,086 --> 00:38:33,049
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

400
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:34,859
with nothing but her eyes.

401
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,502
Finish a man?

402
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:45,591
Kings traveled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

403
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,167
Magisters sold their palaces.

404
00:38:48,712 --> 00:38:51,834
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

405
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,630
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

406
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:58,209
and she refused them all.

407
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,392
Well, she sounds
like an interesting woman.

408
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,434
I don't think
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

409
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,893
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

410
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,117
Men want what they've never had.

411
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:14,440
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

412
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:17,818
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

413
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:31,233
Then don't make love like a slave.

414
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:42,236
Very good, Khaleesi.

415
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:44,428
Out there he is the mighty Khal,

416
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:48,286
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

417
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:52,803
I don't think
that this is the Dothraki way.

418
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:55,398
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

419
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:58,119
why did he marry you?

420
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:47,027
Pardon me, Ser.

421
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:53,034
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

422
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,979
Or is it him there making you shake?

423
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:00,376
He frightens me too.

424
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:01,954
Look at that face.

425
00:43:04,027 --> 00:43:05,588
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.

426
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:16,557
- Why won't he speak to me?
- He hasn't been very talkative.

427
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:19,982
Since the mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

428
00:43:20,354 --> 00:43:22,452
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

429
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:26,066
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.

430
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:29,454
The royal executioner.

431
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:33,422
What is it, sweet lady?

432
00:43:35,855 --> 00:43:37,428
Does the hound frighten you?

433
00:43:38,378 --> 00:43:39,663
Away with you, dog.

434
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,351
You're scaring my lady.

435
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,215
I don't like to see you upset.

436
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:51,047
The Sun is finally shining.

437
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:53,405
Come walk with me.

438
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,400
Stay, Lady.

439
00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:15,839
I probably shouldn't have any more.

440
00:44:15,964 --> 00:44:18,287
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

441
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:20,974
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

442
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:36,262
Don't worry... you're safe with me.

443
00:44:37,403 --> 00:44:38,780
I'll get you!

444
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:49,900
What are you doing here?

445
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:51,868
- Go away.
- Your sister?

446
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:58,325
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

447
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,452
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

448
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:03,831
A butcher's boy
who wants to be a Knight, eh?

449
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:08,377
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

450
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:11,119
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

451
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:12,718
I'm your prince,

452
00:45:13,968 --> 00:45:15,908
not your lord, and I said

453
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:18,689
pick up your sword.

454
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:22,236
- It's not a sword, it's only a stick.
- And you're not a Knight.

455
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:25,972
Only a butcher's boy.

456
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:29,623
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

457
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:31,859
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

458
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:33,862
I won't hurt him...

459
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,196
Much.

460
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:48,959
Filthy little bitch!

461
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:51,086
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you.

462
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:53,088
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

463
00:45:54,308 --> 00:45:56,300
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

464
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:01,263
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

465
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:13,275
Please don't.

466
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:15,085
Arya, leave him alone.

467
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:37,538
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

468
00:46:38,153 --> 00:46:40,502
Stay here, I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

469
00:46:40,627 --> 00:46:41,512
Then go!

470
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:44,966
Don't touch me.

471
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:50,771
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

472
00:46:56,887 --> 00:47:00,385
You've got to go. They'll kill
you for what you did to Joffrey.

473
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:02,769
Go on... run.

474
00:47:06,288 --> 00:47:08,392
Go! Leave now!

475
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:12,709
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

476
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:21,885
I think I heard a noise.

477
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,511
Go!

478
00:47:53,122 --> 00:47:54,123
My lord!

479
00:47:55,444 --> 00:47:57,380
My lord! They found her.

480
00:47:57,505 --> 00:47:58,568
She's unharmed.

481
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:02,549
- Where is she?
- She's been taken before the King.

482
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,901
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

483
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,802
Right, get back.

484
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,415
The Queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

485
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,308
Back! Back to the inn.

486
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:13,859
All back!

487
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:23,530
I'm sorry.

488
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:25,782
- Are you hurt?
- No.

489
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:27,651
It's all right.

490
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,815
What is the meaning of this?

491
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:35,000
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

492
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,337
- How dare you speak in that manner?
- Quiet, woman.

493
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:40,464
Sorry.

494
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:42,671
I never meant to frighten the girl.

495
00:48:43,206 --> 00:48:45,052
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

496
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:48,507
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

497
00:48:49,216 --> 00:48:51,216
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

498
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,648
That's not true!

499
00:48:53,385 --> 00:48:55,555
She just... Bit him a little.

500
00:48:57,148 --> 00:48:58,857
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us.

501
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:02,694
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

502
00:49:02,862 --> 00:49:05,297
- That's not what happened!
- Yes it is!

503
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:07,616
They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

504
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:08,977
- Liar!
- Shut up!

505
00:49:09,102 --> 00:49:10,103
Enough!

506
00:49:10,578 --> 00:49:13,059
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

507
00:49:13,623 --> 00:49:15,749
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

508
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:20,796
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed asleep.

509
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:22,158
She's not.

510
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,107
Sansa, come here, darling.

511
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:38,146
Now, child...

512
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:40,814
Tell me what happened.

513
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,402
Tell it all and tell it true.

514
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,946
It's a great crime to lie to a King.

515
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:55,878
I don't know.

516
00:49:56,736 --> 00:49:57,791
I don't remember.

517
00:49:58,147 --> 00:50:00,053
Everything happened so fast.

518
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,468
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

519
00:50:03,593 --> 00:50:05,028
- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!

520
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:07,718
- Stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

521
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:10,220
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

522
00:50:10,946 --> 00:50:12,139
I want her punished.

523
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:14,474
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

524
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:17,801
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

525
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:20,529
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

526
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:25,402
You let that little girl disarm you?

527
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:34,742
See to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

528
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:37,613
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.

529
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:40,439
And what of the direwolf?

530
00:50:41,628 --> 00:50:43,786
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

531
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,287
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

532
00:50:49,728 --> 00:50:52,370
We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.

533
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:56,995
- So be it.
- We have another wolf.

534
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,298
As you will.

535
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:04,188
You can't mean it.

536
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:05,929
A direwolf's no pet.

537
00:51:06,414 --> 00:51:08,542
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

538
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:11,613
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

539
00:51:12,718 --> 00:51:15,410
No no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

540
00:51:15,578 --> 00:51:17,162
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

541
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,081
You leave her alone!

542
00:51:19,249 --> 00:51:20,999
Stop them.
Don't let them do it. Please!

543
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,863
It wasn't Lady!

544
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:24,503
Is this your command...

545
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:27,089
your Grace?

546
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:36,598
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.

547
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:39,418
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

548
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,120
Jory...

549
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:47,173
Take the girls to their rooms.

550
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,447
If it must be done,

551
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:56,076
then I'll do it myself.

552
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:57,773
Is this some trick?

553
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,348
The wolf is of the north.

554
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:03,983
She deserves better than a butcher.

555
00:52:38,038 --> 00:52:39,461
The butcher's boy...

556
00:52:40,596 --> 00:52:43,079
- you rode him down?
- He ran...

557
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:45,080
Not very fast.
