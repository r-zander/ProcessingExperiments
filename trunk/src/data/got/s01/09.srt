2
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:10,005
You've seen better days, My Lord.

3
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:12,653
Another visit?

4
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:17,132
It seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:17,257 --> 00:02:20,015
No no, many still love you.

6
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,939
Sansa came to court this morning

7
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:24,972
to plead for your life.

8
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,690
On her knees, begging for me.

9
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,645
Did you laugh with the others?

10
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,397
You do me wrong, My Lord.

11
00:02:33,563 --> 00:02:37,407
- Your blood is the last thing I want.
- I don't know what you want.

12
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,951
I've given up trying to guess.

13
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,485
When I was still a boy...

14
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,918
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife...

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,250
I traveled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

16
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:56,760
They taught me
that each man has a role to play.

17
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,479
The same is true at court.

18
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:01,924
I am the master of whisperers.

19
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,029
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

20
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,779
I'm a good actor, My Lord.

21
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,901
Can you free me from this pit?

22
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,174
I could.

23
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,404
But will I?

24
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:17,072
No.

25
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:19,992
As I said, I'm no hero.

26
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,958
What do you want? Tell me.

27
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,921
No riddles, no stories.
Tell me, what do you want?

28
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,015
Peace.

29
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:33,328
Did you know that your son is marching
south with an army of Northmen?

30
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:37,324
Loyal lad
fighting for his father's freedom.

31
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,931
- He's just a boy.
- Boys have been conquerors before.

32
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,556
But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights is the King's...

33
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,373
the late King's brother.

34
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:53,491
Lord Stannis has the best claim
to the Throne,

35
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,800
he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

36
00:03:56,925 --> 00:04:00,992
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The Throne is his by rights.

37
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:05,826
Sansa pleaded so sweetly
for your life,

38
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,998
it would be a shame to throw it away.

39
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,285
Cersei is no fool.

40
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,379
She knows a tame wolf

41
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,152
is more use to her than a dead one.

42
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:17,496
You want me to serve the woman
who murdered my King,

43
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:20,386
who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?

44
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,429
I want you to serve the realm!

45
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,393
Tell you will confess your treason,
tell your son to lay down his sword

46
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,646
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

47
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:35,693
Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

48
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:41,024
If you give her the peace she needs
and carry her secret to your grave,

49
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:44,486
I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days

50
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:47,037
on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.

51
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:50,958
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

52
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:54,670
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years...

53
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,272
Of what?

54
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,878
You grew up with actors.

55
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,789
You learned their craft
and you learned it well.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,150
But I grew up with soldiers.

57
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,216
I learned how to die a long time ago.

58
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:21,774
Pity.

59
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:24,700
Such a pity.

60
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,965
What of your daughter's life,
My Lord?

61
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,899
Is that a precious thing to you?

62
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:21,193
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

63
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,802
- Or so Walder would have you think.
- Keep shooting them down.

64
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,930
We can't risk Lord Walder sending word
of your movements to the Lannisters.

65
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,182
He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

66
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,979
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

67
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,318
Look.

68
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,151
Father rots in a dungeon.

69
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,278
How long before they take his head?

70
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,586
We need to cross the Trident now.

71
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,160
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

72
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:51,322
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

73
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,896
Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

74
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,418
The Freys have held the crossing
for 600 years,

75
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,838
and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.

76
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:03,262
Have my horse saddled and ready.

77
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:06,261
Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannisters.

78
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,492
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

79
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:15,013
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

80
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,488
Whatever it took.

81
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:21,485
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't
have other men doing my bargaining.

82
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:23,386
I agree.

83
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:26,483
- I'll go.
- You can't!

84
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:29,289
I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.

85
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:30,910
He would never harm me.

86
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,555
Unless there was a profit in it.

87
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:40,878
What do you want?

88
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,660
It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.

89
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:46,551
Oh spare me.

90
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,637
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

91
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,225
- What am I supposed to do with you?
- Father, you forget yourself.

92
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:56,603
Lady Stark is here...

93
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:00,565
Who asked you? You're not
Lord Frey yet, not until I die.

94
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,326
- Do I look dead to you?
- Father, please...

95
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:06,112
I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?

96
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:10,491
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

97
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,208
All right, you come forward.

98
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,512
There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,

99
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,808
perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.

100
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:43,274
Is there somewhere we can talk?

101
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,714
We're talking right now.

102
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:50,599
Fine.

103
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,270
Out!

104
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:53,761
All of you!

105
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,338
You too.

106
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,403
You see that?

107
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,362
15 she is.

108
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:18,771
A little flower.

109
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:22,581
And her honey's all mine.

110
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,111
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

111
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,215
Your father didn't come
to the wedding.

112
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,090
He is quite ill, My Lord.

113
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,959
Didn't come to the last one either.
Or the one before that.

114
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,388
Your family has always pissed on me.

115
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,345
Don't deny it. You know it's true.

116
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,423
The fine Lord Tully

117
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,139
would never marry
any of his children to mine.

118
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,803
- I'm sure there were reasons why...
- I didn't need reasons.

119
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,724
I needed to get rid of sons
and daughters. You see how they pile up?

120
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:04,133
Why are you here?

121
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:10,430
To ask you
to open your gates, My Lord,

122
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:14,755
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

123
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,992
Why should I let him?

124
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:20,580
If you could climb your own battlements,
you would see that he has 20,000 men

125
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,707
- outside your walls.
- They'll be 20,000 corpses

126
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:27,587
when Tywin Lannister gets here.
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

127
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,240
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

128
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:33,254
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

129
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,918
You swore an oath to my father.

130
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,220
Oh yes, I said some words...

131
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:41,934
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

132
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,523
Joffrey's King now, which makes
your boy and his corpses-to-be

133
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,586
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

134
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:53,128
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

135
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,059
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

136
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,380
Why don't you?

137
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:59,994
Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon,

138
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,846
give me one good reason

139
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,699
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

140
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,619
<i>And... engage.</i>

141
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,617
When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?

142
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,542
Soon, he says.

143
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,668
Good.

144
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,828
You'll be ready for this then.

145
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:23,518
I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you

146
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:25,686
than a bear...

147
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:29,721
So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

148
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,490
Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

149
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:45,915
This is Valyrian steel.

150
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,794
It was my father's sword,

151
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,706
his father before him.

152
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,762
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

153
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,373
It was meant for my son Jorah.

154
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:00,456
He brought dishonor to our House,

155
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,478
but he had the grace
to leave the sword

156
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,518
before he fled from Westeros.

157
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:08,021
My Lord, you honor me, but I can't...

158
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,251
Oh, you can

159
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,072
and you will.

160
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:15,227
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

161
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,539
A bloody dead man tried to kill me...

162
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,267
So you'll take it.

163
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,477
I'll hear no more about it.

164
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,957
- Is that understood?
- Yes, My Lord.

165
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,596
Now don't think this means

166
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:33,914
I approve of this nonsense
with you and Alliser Thorne.

167
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,393
That's a man's sword,

168
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,867
it'll take a man to wield it.

169
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:41,638
I'll apologize
to Ser Alliser tonight.

170
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,034
No you won't!

171
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,184
I sent him to King's Landing
yesterday.

172
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:49,229
The hand that your wolf tore
off that thing's wrist...

173
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,153
I've ordered Thorne to lay it
at the feet of this...

174
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,567
Boy King.

175
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,491
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

176
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:01,400
And it puts a thousand leagues

177
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,682
between you and Thorne.

178
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,455
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe

179
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,999
and bring me my supper.

180
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,423
Yes, My Lord.

181
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,188
You earned that, Snow.

182
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,440
Well done.

183
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,466
Go on, let's have a look.

184
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:43,025
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

185
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,702
Sword! Sword!
Sword! Sword!

186
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:55,963
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

187
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,046
Get off of it.
Piss off.

188
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,651
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

189
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,371
Give it here!

190
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,280
What is it?

191
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,521
I can't.

192
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:14,966
You can't what?

193
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,269
I... I'm really not supposed to say.

194
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:23,532
And yet you really want to say.

195
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,680
You want to say that...?

196
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:30,973
There was a raven.

197
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,067
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

198
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,746
It's your brother Robb.

199
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,245
What?

200
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,340
What about him?

201
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:44,484
He's heading south.

202
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:45,865
To war.

203
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:52,230
All his bannermen have rallied
to his side. They'll keep him safe.

204
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:55,343
I should be there.

205
00:14:58,156 --> 00:14:59,596
I should be with him.

206
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:17,083
... If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

207
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:19,787
Well?

208
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:21,902
What did he say?

209
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,842
Lord Walder has granted
your crossing.

210
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:30,180
His men are yours as well.

211
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,042
Less the 400 he will keep here
to hold the crossing

212
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,667
against any who would pursue you.

213
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,241
And what does he want in return?

214
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:39,871
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

215
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:43,589
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine fine.

216
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,811
And?

217
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:49,997
And Arya

218
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,204
will marry his son Waldron

219
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,374
- <i>when they both come of age.</i>
- She won't be happy about that.

220
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:01,338
And?

221
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,297
And

222
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:07,713
when the fighting is done...

223
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,999
You will marry one of his daughters.

224
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,915
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

225
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:18,689
He has a number he thinks
will be... suitable.

226
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:20,009
I see.

227
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,684
Did you get a look at his daughters?

228
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,302
<i>I did.</i>

229
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:28,699
And?

230
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:31,533
One was...

231
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:39,161
Do you consent?

232
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,503
Can I refuse?

233
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,547
Not if you want to cross.

234
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,566
Then I consent.

235
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,807
Sam said you wanted to see me?

236
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,119
I did indeed.

237
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,772
Perhaps you would be
kind enough to assist me.

238
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:47,880
Tell me, did you ever wonder

239
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,500
why the men of The Night's Watch

240
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,275
take no wives and father no children?

241
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,183
No.

242
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,599
So they will not love.

243
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,734
Love is the death of duty.

244
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,080
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose

245
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,202
between honor on the one hand

246
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,165
and those he loves on the other,

247
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,562
what would he do?

248
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:17,432
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

249
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,980
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

250
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,397
Most of us are not so strong.

251
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,631
What is honor

252
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,903
compared to a woman's love?

253
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,089
<i>And what is duty</i>

254
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:36,076
against the feel of a newborn son
in your arms?

255
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:38,788
Or a brother's smile?

256
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,501
Sam told you.

257
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:46,002
We're all human.

258
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,724
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

259
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,229
Honor comes easy then.

260
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,769
Yet sooner or later

261
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,417
in every man's life

262
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,643
there comes a day
when it is not easy,

263
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:04,813
a day when he must choose.

264
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,334
And this is my day?

265
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,713
Is that what you're saying?

266
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,388
Oh, it hurts, boy.

267
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:14,072
Oh yes.

268
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,101
- I know.
- You do not know!

269
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,088
No one knows.

270
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,632
I may be a bastard,

271
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,555
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

272
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:35,299
The Gods were cruel when they
saw fit to test my vows.

273
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:37,887
They waited till I was old.

274
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:43,340
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

275
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,062
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

276
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:48,249
I was helpless,

277
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:49,858
blind,

278
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:51,344
frail.

279
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:58,591
But when I heard they had
killed my brother's son,

280
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,727
and his poor son...

281
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:02,495
And the children!

282
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:04,979
Even the little children.

283
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,710
Who are you?

284
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:12,098
My father

285
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,195
was Maekar,

286
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,964
the first of his name.

287
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,941
My brother Aegon

288
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:20,876
reigned after him

289
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,288
when I had refused the Throne.

290
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:27,269
And he was followed by his son Aerys,

291
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,399
whom they called the Mad King.

292
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:32,484
You're Aemon Targaryen.

293
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,732
I'm a Maester of the Citadel,

294
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,429
bound in service to Castle Black
and The Night's Watch.

295
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,113
I will not tell you

296
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,582
to stay or go.

297
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,650
You must make that choice yourself,

298
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:55,582
and live with it
for the rest of your days.

299
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,596
As I have.

300
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:56,727
Our scouts tell us

301
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:59,481
the Stark host has moved
south from the Twins

302
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:01,552
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

303
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,756
They're a day's march north.

304
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:07,065
The boy may lack
experience and sense,

305
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,585
but he does have a certain mindless

306
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,371
provincial courage.

307
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:19,135
Do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

308
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,548
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

309
00:23:21,673 --> 00:23:23,623
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

310
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:27,108
The great hairy one insisted he
must have two battle axes...

311
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:29,677
heavy black steel, double-sided.

312
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:31,127
Shagga likes axes.

313
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:34,166
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

314
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,944
will be in the vanguard.

315
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,645
The vanguard?

316
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:39,963
Me and the tribesmen
on the front lines?

317
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:43,217
They do seem rather ferocious.

318
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,881
Ferocious?

319
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:48,850
Last night

320
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:52,434
a Moon brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

321
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:56,271
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon
brother and opened his throat.

322
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:59,088
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

323
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:00,286
which was fortunate,

324
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:03,320
but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

325
00:24:03,695 --> 00:24:06,085
which Shagga and Gunthor
refuse to pay.

326
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,243
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

327
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:12,871
Surely there are ways to have me killed
less detrimental to the war effort.

328
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:15,395
There'll be no more
discussion on the matter.

329
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:22,638
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

330
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:24,469
Excuse me, My Lords.

331
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:40,612
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

332
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:43,064
- I took her.
- Took her?

333
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:46,450
- From whom?
- From...

334
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,352
Ser... what's his name?

335
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:51,160
Ginger cunt three tents down.

336
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,246
And he didn't have anything
to say about it?

337
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,090
He said something.

338
00:25:01,763 --> 00:25:05,424
The odds of me living long enough
for him to retaliate just dropped.

339
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:08,021
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

340
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:11,959
Oh well.

341
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:18,267
I think I'll go and find myself one.

342
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:23,108
Who are you?

343
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,319
Who would you like me to be?

344
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:27,779
What did your mother call you?

345
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,694
Shae.

346
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,450
What did your mother call you?

347
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,113
My mother died giving birth to me.

348
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,824
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

349
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:41,084
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

350
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,048
What do you want from me?

351
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:48,699
What do I want from you?

352
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:52,137
I want you to share my tent.

353
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:55,224
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

354
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,212
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

355
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,395
I want you to take
no other man to bed

356
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:02,380
for as long as we're together.

357
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,719
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

358
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:08,070
Which it may well be.

359
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,530
And what do I get?

360
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:12,249
One, safety.

361
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,453
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

362
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:20,101
Two, the pleasure of my company,

363
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:23,877
- which I have heard is spectacular.
- Who told you this?

364
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:26,046
- Women you paid?
- And three:

365
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:31,036
More gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

366
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:35,013
Do you accept my proposal?

367
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,892
Let's start with your last night
in this world.

368
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,321
Come.

369
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:36,334
He's very strong.

370
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:39,693
No one understands how strong he is.

371
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,981
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

372
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,603
He can't. I won't let him.

373
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,501
Even a Queen doesn't have that power.

374
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:13,945
We must go quickly. I've heard
there's a good port in Asshai...

375
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,541
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

376
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,337
Even if he dies,

377
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,043
why would I run?

378
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,337
I am Khaleesi

379
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:34,051
and my son will be Khal after Drogo.

380
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,826
This isn't Westeros
where men honor blood.

381
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,097
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting

382
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:41,613
after Drogo dies.

383
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,587
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new Khal.

384
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:46,823
He won't want any rivals.

385
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:48,397
Your boy will be plucked

386
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,063
from your breast
and given to the dogs.

387
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:54,725
I won't leave him.

388
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:06,957
The wound has festered.

389
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,582
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, Ser.

390
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:12,827
I think you're right.

391
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:19,821
You've saved me once more.

392
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:22,365
And now you must save him.

393
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:24,659
He's beyond the healer's skills.

394
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:27,272
All I can do is ease his path.

395
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:29,414
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.

396
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,375
You must know a way...

397
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,094
Some magic.

398
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:40,912
There is a spell.

399
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,948
Some would say death is cleaner.

400
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:55,941
Do it.

401
00:30:56,886 --> 00:30:57,887
Save him.

402
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,488
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold. Whatever you want.

403
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:03,947
It's not a matter of gold.
This is Bloodmagic.

404
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,950
Only death pays for life.

405
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:10,666
My death?

406
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,946
Not your death, Khaleesi.

407
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:17,212
Bring me his horse.

408
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:44,281
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.
Let me kill this witch.

409
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:46,437
Kill her and you kill your Khal.

410
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:49,036
This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.

411
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:52,790
I am your Khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

412
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,510
Go now!

413
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:07,520
Take her and leave.
Take her!

414
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:12,226
Irriya?

415
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,175
You must go also, lady.

416
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,565
Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

417
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:20,192
The dead will dance here tonight.

418
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,291
No one will enter.

419
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,843
Bring him back to me.

420
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,067
What have you done?

421
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:05,799
I have to save him.

422
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:10,197
We could have been 10 miles away from
here by now on the way to Asshai.

423
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,900
You would have been safe.

424
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,491
Are you hurt?

425
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:17,617
The baby...

426
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:18,982
... Is coming.

427
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:21,712
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come.

428
00:34:21,837 --> 00:34:23,403
They say she is cursed.

429
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,836
They'll come or I'll
have their heads.

430
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:30,184
The witch... she can bring baby.

431
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,854
I hear her say so.

432
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:57,125
Are you in agony, my lion?

433
00:34:58,074 --> 00:34:59,727
You look like you're in agony.

434
00:35:00,444 --> 00:35:02,701
The fire is burning
your pretty soft skin.

435
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:12,571
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

436
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,425
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

437
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,662
Let's play a new game.

438
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,195
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you...

439
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,725
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

440
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:28,093
- Not if you win.
- No!

441
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,258
No more fire games, no knife games.

442
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:34,288
Let's do something I'm good at.

443
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:36,556
What are you good at?

444
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,655
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

445
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,959
- This sounds like a boring game.
- <i>It's not.</i>

446
00:35:41,084 --> 00:35:42,563
Here's how it works:

447
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:45,222
I make a statement about your past.

448
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:48,106
If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

449
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,345
And no lying.

450
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,394
I'll know if you're lying.

451
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,131
I don't want to play this game.

452
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:54,735
Fine.
Bronn first.

453
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,119
Your father beat you.

454
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:08,903
But my mother hit harder.

455
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:15,039
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

456
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:16,542
It was a woman.

457
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,301
She swung an axe at me.

458
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:24,979
You've been North of the Wall.

459
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,109
What brought you up there?

460
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:32,570
Work.

461
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:33,737
And...

462
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,517
You once loved a woman
many years ago,

463
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:39,827
but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.

464
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,804
Oh wait, that's me.

465
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:50,363
Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.

466
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,882
- I don't want to play.
- It's fun!

467
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,755
Look at the fun we're having.

468
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,472
Your mother was a whore.

469
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:03,459
Drink.

470
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:11,012
All right.

471
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,724
Your father left the family when
you were very young,

472
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:15,958
never to return.

473
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,084
Drink.

474
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,950
We've established
the rules about lying?

475
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:21,076
Drink!

476
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,038
You wanted a different life.

477
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:33,122
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

478
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:35,581
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

479
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:36,905
So specifics...

480
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:40,790
you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

481
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:44,224
I don't believe the life
of the silent sisters is for you.

482
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,164
So what's a lowborn girl to do?

483
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:53,943
Drink.

484
00:37:56,968 --> 00:37:58,627
- Are you sure...
- drink!

485
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:07,297
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever

486
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:10,649
or I will carve your eyes
from your head.

487
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,925
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

488
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:20,092
My turn.

489
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,238
Fine fine.

490
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:23,875
Ask away.

491
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:27,017
Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.

492
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:31,093
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

493
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:33,232
I don't care the way the game works.

494
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,192
Our Lord here used to be married.

495
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,194
Married?

496
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,700
How did you hear that?

497
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:41,894
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

498
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:46,235
Another night, perhaps.

499
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:48,964
Not another night.
This night.

500
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:52,167
It's not a pleasant story.

501
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:55,928
Or maybe I will cry.

502
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:59,984
The lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your Lordship.

503
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:03,637
So...

504
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:09,615
I was 16.

505
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:13,061
My brother Jaime and I were riding
when we heard a scream.

506
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:15,865
She ran out onto the road,

507
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,402
clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.

508
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:22,493
Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

509
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:25,023
She was too scared to send off
on her own,

510
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,869
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers

511
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,997
I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.

512
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,133
Her name was Tysha.

513
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:34,565
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

514
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:36,668
And she was hungry...

515
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:40,835
together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.

516
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,285
Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

517
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,014
I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,

518
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:50,783
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me

519
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:52,978
or look away embarrassed

520
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:55,495
or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.

521
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,474
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

522
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:02,237
And somehow I found
myself in her bed.

523
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:04,463
For three chickens, I should hope so.

524
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,410
It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

525
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,609
But she was good to me.

526
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,800
She kissed me afterwards

527
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,566
and sang me a song.

528
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:20,570
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

529
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:24,133
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon

530
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,185
and there you have it...
man and wife.

531
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,992
For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up

532
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,478
and told my father.

533
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:35,277
I imagine that was
the end of all that.

534
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:36,403
Not quite.

535
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,769
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

536
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:44,630
The girl was a whore, you see.

537
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,534
Jaime had arranged the whole thing,

538
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:51,375
the road, the rapers... all of it.

539
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:53,956
He thought it was time I had a woman.

540
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:58,210
After my brother confessed,

541
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,333
my father brought in my wife

542
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,423
and gave her to his guards.

543
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:07,716
He paid her well...
a silver for each man.

544
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,414
How many whores command
that kind of price?

545
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,591
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

546
00:41:16,649 --> 00:41:19,440
By the end, she had so much silver

547
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:22,358
that the coins were
slipping through her fingers

548
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:24,344
and rolling onto the floor.

549
00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:31,035
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

550
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:34,164
You should have known
she was a whore.

551
00:41:35,443 --> 00:41:36,444
Really?

552
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:39,499
I was 16, drunk and in love...

553
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:41,328
A girl who was almost raped

554
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:44,176
doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.

555
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,672
As I said,

556
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,583
I was young and stupid.

557
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,718
You are still young and stupid.

558
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:40,271
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

559
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:42,769
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

560
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:44,651
They're a mile north.

561
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:47,820
- <i>Get my squire!</i>
- You don't have a squire.

562
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:52,543
If I die, weep for me.

563
00:42:54,046 --> 00:42:56,873
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

564
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:04,837
I'll know.

565
00:43:07,342 --> 00:43:08,549
Watch out!
Move!

566
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:21,744
Stay low.

567
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,690
Stay low?

568
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:26,735
If you're lucky,
no one will notice you.

569
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,352
I was born lucky.

570
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,308
Tribesmen of the Vale,

571
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,303
gather round!

572
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:38,413
Stone Crows!

573
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:41,666
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

574
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,377
- Moon Brothers!
- And Painted Dogs!

575
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:45,963
And Painted Dogs!

576
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:50,258
Your dominion over the Vale
begins now!

577
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,468
Onward to claim what is yours!

578
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:54,554
Half man!

579
00:44:01,984 --> 00:44:02,812
To battle.

580
00:44:46,213 --> 00:44:47,523
You're a shit warrior.

581
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:52,445
I'm alive?

582
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:54,808
You're alive.

583
00:45:00,386 --> 00:45:01,204
Did we win?

584
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,832
We wouldn't be having this conversation
if we didn't.

585
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:19,980
How did our tribesmen do?

586
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:23,729
Yeah, good.

587
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:27,105
It's nice to see them getting along.

588
00:45:27,848 --> 00:45:29,148
You're wounded.

589
00:45:30,413 --> 00:45:32,360
Good of you to notice.

590
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,487
I hear we won.

591
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:37,949
The scouts were wrong.

592
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:41,361
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen,
not 20,000.

593
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:44,269
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

594
00:45:44,394 --> 00:45:45,581
He wasn't here.

595
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,835
Where was he?

596
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:50,868
With his other 18,000 men.

597
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:55,990
And where are they?

598
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:08,626
- We should go, My Lady.
- No!

599
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:54,278
By the time they knew
what was happening, it had happened.

600
00:46:58,487 --> 00:47:00,656
Lady Stark.
I'd offer you my sword,

601
00:47:00,822 --> 00:47:02,533
but I seem to have lost it.

602
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:04,596
It's not your sword I want.

603
00:47:06,163 --> 00:47:08,664
Give me my daughters back.
Give me my husband.

604
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:12,293
I've lost them too.

605
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:14,837
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

606
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:16,923
He cut down 10 of our men,
you saw him.

607
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:19,803
He's more use to us alive than dead.

608
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:22,760
Take him away and put him in irons.

609
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:25,555
We could end this war right now, boy,

610
00:47:25,982 --> 00:47:27,629
save thousands of lives.

611
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:30,829
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

612
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:32,772
Swords or lances, teeth, nails...

613
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:34,299
Choose your weapons

614
00:47:34,424 --> 00:47:36,484
and let's end this here and now.

615
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:41,146
If we do it your way, Kingslayer,

616
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:43,157
you'd win.

617
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,579
We're not doing it your way.

618
00:47:50,843 --> 00:47:52,633
Come on, pretty man.

619
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:03,970
I sent 2,000 men
to their graves today.

620
00:48:04,136 --> 00:48:06,664
The bards will sing songs
of their sacrifice.

621
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:10,025
But the dead won't hear them.

622
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:19,026
One victory does not
make us conquerors.

623
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,728
Did we free my father?

624
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:26,502
Did we rescue my sisters
from the Queen?

625
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:31,624
Did we free the North
from those who want us on our knees?

626
00:48:37,055 --> 00:48:38,799
This war is far from over.

627
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:11,579
Could I have one?

628
00:49:12,353 --> 00:49:13,497
A lemon one...

629
00:49:13,663 --> 00:49:14,707
or any of them.

630
00:49:14,873 --> 00:49:15,708
3 coppers.

631
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:18,461
How about a nice fat pigeon?

632
00:49:18,627 --> 00:49:20,144
Piss off now.
Go on.

633
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:24,308
Any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

634
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:25,595
Piss off!

635
00:49:33,693 --> 00:49:35,476
Where's everyone going?
What's happening?

636
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:38,064
- They take him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

637
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,556
The Hand of the King.

638
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,880
Baelor!

639
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,377
I am Eddard Stark,

640
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:25,262
Lord of Winterfell

641
00:51:26,002 --> 00:51:27,882
and Hand of the King.

642
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:39,560
I come before you
to confess my treason

643
00:51:40,987 --> 00:51:42,688
in the sight of Gods and men.

644
00:51:44,786 --> 00:51:46,317
I betrayed the faith of my King

645
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,528
and the trust of my friend Robert.

646
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:53,716
I swore to protect
and defend his children,

647
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,564
but before his blood was cold

648
00:51:57,463 --> 00:51:58,913
I plotted to murder his son

649
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:02,833
and seize the Throne for myself.

650
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,012
Let the high Septon

651
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:19,304
and Baelor the blessed
bear witness to what I say:

652
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:23,873
Joffrey Baratheon

653
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:27,400
is the one true heir
to the Iron Throne,

654
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:30,431
by the Grace of all the Gods,

655
00:52:31,153 --> 00:52:33,077
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

656
00:52:34,129 --> 00:52:35,850
and Protector of the Realm.

657
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:45,222
As we sin,

658
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:47,504
so do we suffer.

659
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,457
This man has confessed his crimes

660
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:53,134
in sight of Gods and men.

661
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,317
The Gods are just

662
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,669
but beloved Baelor taught us

663
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:03,040
they can also be merciful.

664
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:10,277
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

665
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:18,243
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

666
00:53:18,914 --> 00:53:20,563
Stripped of all titles and powers,

667
00:53:20,688 --> 00:53:23,093
he would serve the realm
in permanent exile.

668
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:25,119
And My Lady Sansa

669
00:53:26,249 --> 00:53:28,165
has begged mercy for her father.

670
00:53:32,631 --> 00:53:35,138
But they have
the soft hearts of women.

671
00:53:36,262 --> 00:53:38,179
So long as I am your King,

672
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,300
treason shall never go unpunished.

673
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:43,280
Ser Ilyn,

674
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:45,854
bring me his head!

675
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,983
Daddy!
Someone stop him!

676
00:54:01,604 --> 00:54:03,204
My son, this is madness.

677
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,415
Put him down!

678
00:54:13,186 --> 00:54:15,216
- Don't look!
- Let me go.

679
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:17,886
Shut your mouth.
Look at me.

680
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,230
Stop him, stop!

681
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:11,693
