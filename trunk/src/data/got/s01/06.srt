2
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:27,402
Your pardon, Your Grace.

3
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:29,704
I would rise, but...

4
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:32,487
Do you know what your wife has done?

5
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,823
She did nothing I did not command.

6
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,923
Who'd have thought she had it in her?

7
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:39,992
By what right dare you lay
hands on my blood?

8
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:41,453
I am the King's Hand.

9
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,289
- You were the King's Hand.
- You shall now be held accountable.

10
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:46,792
Will both of you shut your mouths?!

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,047
Catelyn will release Tyrion
and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

12
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,299
He butchered my men...

13
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,428
Lord Stark was returning drunk
from a brothel

14
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,389
- when his men attacked Jaime.
- Quiet.

15
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:02,891
Jaime has fled the city.

16
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,686
Give me leave
to bring him back to justice.

17
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:10,732
- I took you for a King.
- Hold your tongue.

18
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:14,227
He's attacked one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

19
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:16,154
I should wear the armor
and you the gown.

20
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,586
I shall wear this
like a badge of honor.

21
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,424
Wear it in silence

22
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,411
or I'll honor you again.

23
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,305
See what she does to me?

24
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,049
My loving wife.

25
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,189
I should not have hit her.

26
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,715
That was not Kingly.

27
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:12,829
If we don't act,

28
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:16,340
there will be a war.

29
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:20,606
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp

30
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,131
to King's Landing.

31
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,938
She's had her fun,
now put an end to it.

32
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,937
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

33
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:32,606
And what about Jaime Lannister?

34
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,407
What about Jaime?

35
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:40,020
I'm half a Kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

36
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:44,594
I don't know what happened between
you and those yellow-haired shits.

37
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,162
I don't want to know.
This is what matters...

38
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,591
I can't rule the Kingdoms

39
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:52,370
if the Starks and the Lannisters
are at each other's throats.

40
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:54,419
So enough.

41
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,446
As you command, Your Grace.

42
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,046
With your leave,

43
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,786
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

44
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,212
Piss on that. Send a raven.
I want you to stay.

45
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,437
I'm the King. I get what I want.

46
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,799
I never loved my brothers.

47
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,414
A sad thing for a man to admit,
but it's true.

48
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:29,106
You were the brother I chose.

49
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,796
We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

50
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:41,535
The hunt?

51
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:44,740
Killing things clears my head.

52
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:48,682
You'll have to sit on the throne
while I'm away.

53
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,809
You'll hate it more than I do.

54
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,602
The Targaryen girl...

55
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,469
Seven hells,
don't start with her again.

56
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:59,109
The girl will die
and I'll hear no more of it.

57
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,501
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

58
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:06,158
I swear to the mother I'll pin
the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

59
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:47,050
You're hurt.

60
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,315
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

61
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,942
When are you gonna tell him?

62
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,111
Not now.

63
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,225
- Blood for blood.
- Come on!

64
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,616
You need to make the Lannisters
pay for Jory and the others.

65
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,444
- You're talking about war.
- I'm talking about justice.

66
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,004
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in
the bannermen and raise an army.

67
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,670
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

68
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,342
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

69
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:07,703
- You want me to march on Casterly Rock?
- You're not a boy anymore.

70
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:11,635
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

71
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,221
It's your duty to represent your House
when your father can't.

72
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,309
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

73
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:31,311
Where's Bran?

74
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,572
I don't know. It's not my House.

75
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:15,031
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

76
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,286
I'm not alone.

77
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,152
- My brother is with me.
- I don't see him.

78
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:26,293
- Got him hidden under your cloak?
- That's a pretty pin.

79
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,962
- Silver.
- We'll take the pin

80
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:30,797
and the horse.

81
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:32,716
Get down.

82
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,302
Be quick about it.

83
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,971
I can't.
The saddle... the straps.

84
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,948
What's wrong with you?

85
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:47,147
- You some kind of cripple?
- I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

86
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,803
If you don't let me be,
I'll have you all killed!

87
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,694
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

88
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,589
The boy's worth nothing dead.

89
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:56,781
Benjen Stark's own blood?

90
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,035
Think what Mance would give us.

91
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,745
Piss on Mance Rayder

92
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,413
and piss on the North.

93
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:06,666
We're going as far South
as South goes.

94
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,534
There ain't no White Walkers
down in Dorne.

95
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:11,671
Drop the knife!

96
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,831
Let him go and I'll let you live.

97
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:40,958
Shut up.

98
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,545
Drop the blade!

99
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,788
- No, don't.
- Do it.

100
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:24,980
Are you all right?

101
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,533
It doesn't hurt.

102
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,375
Tough little lad.

103
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:34,705
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your first enemy.

104
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:36,047
Well done.

105
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:39,092
Have you lost your mind?

106
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:43,430
- What if you'd missed?
- He would have killed you and Bran.

107
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,070
- You don't have the right...
- To what, to save your brother's life?

108
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,768
It was the only thing to do,
so I did it.

109
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,522
What about her?

110
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:01,364
Give me my life, My Lord,
and I'm yours.

111
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:05,285
We'll keep her alive.

112
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,630
Mord!

113
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,468
Turnkey! Mord!

114
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,490
Dwarf man making noise!

115
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:47,994
How would you like to be rich?

116
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,201
Dwarf man still making noise.

117
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,876
My family is rich.
We have gold, lots of gold.

118
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:57,754
I'm prepared to give you
lots of gold in...

119
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:00,767
No gold!

120
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:04,010
Well, I don't have it here.

121
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,221
No gold.

122
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:07,635
Fuck off.

123
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:36,292
I don't want to practice today.

124
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:38,063
No?

125
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,462
They killed Jory.

126
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:42,939
My father is hurt.

127
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,553
I don't care
about stupid wooden swords.

128
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,513
You are troubled.

129
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:50,181
- Yes.
- Good!

130
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,475
Trouble is the perfect time
for training.

131
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,770
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

132
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,772
this is not when fighting happens.

133
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,454
I don't like dolls and k...

134
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:02,169
You're not here.

135
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:05,579
You're with your trouble.

136
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,908
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens...

137
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,635
More trouble for you.

138
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:16,953
Just so.

139
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,795
How can you be quick as a snake...

140
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,009
Or as quiet as a shadow...

141
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,441
When you are somewhere else?

142
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,688
You are fearing for your father.

143
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,499
That is right.

144
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:44,944
Do you pray to the Gods?

145
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,487
The old and the new.

146
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,074
There is only one God

147
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:53,056
and his name is Death.

148
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,065
And there is only one thing
we say to Death:

149
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,395
"Not today."

150
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,318
She has to eat the whole heart?

151
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,323
I hope that wasn't my horse.

152
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,241
She's doing well.

153
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,221
She'll never keep it down.

154
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,447
- Tell me what she's saying.
- "The prince is riding.

155
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,259
"I have heard
the thunder of his hooves.

156
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,443
"Swift as the wind he rides.

157
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,515
"His enemies will cower before him...

158
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,451
"And their wives
will weep tears of blood."

159
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,583
She's going to have a boy.

160
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,805
He won't be a real Targaryen.

161
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,425
He won't be a true Dragon.

162
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,634
"The stallion who mounts the world."

163
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,042
The stallion is the Khal of Khals.

164
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:33,330
He shall unite the people
into a single Khalasar.

165
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,790
All the people of the world
will be his herd.

166
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,186
They love her.

167
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,422
She truly is a queen today.

168
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:04,371
Don't let them see you
carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

169
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,668
You know the law.

170
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,080
It's not my law.

171
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,522
- They don't belong to you.
- Whatever is hers is also mine.

172
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:15,507
Once, perhaps.

173
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,437
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

174
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,402
Two eggs... a ship and an army.

175
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:25,809
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

176
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,354
I'm the last hope
of a dynasty, Mormont.

177
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,312
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

178
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:34,974
on my shoulders
since I was five years old...

179
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,863
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent.

180
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,291
Never.

181
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,241
Not a piece of it.

182
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,047
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it?

183
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,790
Who can rule
without wealth or fear or love?

184
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,221
You stand there,
all nobility and honor.

185
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,096
You don't think I see you
looking at my little sister?

186
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:05,637
Don't think I know what you want?

187
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:10,231
I don't care.

188
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,867
You can have her.

189
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:16,401
She can be Queen of the savages,
dine on the finest bloody horseparts,

190
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,030
and you can dine
on whichever parts of her you like.

191
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:21,952
But let me go.

192
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:25,761
You can go.

193
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:27,885
You can't have the eggs.

194
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,706
You swore an oath to me.

195
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:32,118
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

196
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,419
It means everything to me.

197
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,998
And yet here you stand.

198
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,690
And yet here I stand.

199
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,065
Mord!

200
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,571
Noise again!

201
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:20,507
- About the gold...
- No gold!

202
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,926
- No gold.
- Listen to me!

203
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,093
Listen to me.

204
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:27,000
Sometimes possession

205
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,265
is an abstract concept...

206
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:34,107
When they captured me,
they took my purse,

207
00:22:34,232 --> 00:22:35,981
but the gold is still mine.

208
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,371
Where?

209
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,901
Where? I don't know where,

210
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,428
but when they free me...

211
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:42,570
You want free?

212
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,910
Go be free.

213
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:49,697
Have you ever heard the phrase

214
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,246
"rich as a Lannister"?

215
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,003
Of course you have!

216
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:58,881
You're a smart man.

217
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:02,005
You know who the Lannisters are.

218
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:04,836
I am a Lannister.

219
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,679
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

220
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:13,259
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

221
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,730
"A Lannister always pays his debts."

222
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:20,903
If you deliver a message from me...

223
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:23,486
to Lady Arryn,

224
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,572
I will be in your debt.

225
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,659
I will owe you gold.

226
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:33,440
If you deliver the message

227
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:37,222
and I live, which I very much
intend to do.

228
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,463
What message?

229
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,999
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

230
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,621
You wish to confess your crimes?

231
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,115
I do, My Lady.

232
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:06,683
The sky cells always break them.

233
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,482
Speak, Imp.

234
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,451
Meet your Gods as an honest man.

235
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:19,397
Where do I begin,
my lords and ladies?

236
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,845
I'm a vile man,

237
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,603
I confess it.

238
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:27,175
My crimes and sins
are beyond counting.

239
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,197
I have lied and cheated...

240
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,375
gambled and whored.

241
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,156
I'm not particularly
good at violence,

242
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,856
but I'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.

243
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:46,611
You want specifics, I suppose.

244
00:24:48,343 --> 00:24:50,693
When I was seven,
I saw a servant girl

245
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:52,690
bathing in the river.

246
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,467
I stole her robe.

247
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,917
She was forced
to return to the castle

248
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,873
naked and in tears.

249
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:02,401
If I close my eyes,

250
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,129
I can still see her tits bouncing.

251
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,175
When I was 10,

252
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,178
I stuffed
my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

253
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:14,514
When confronted with my crime,

254
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,315
I blamed a squire.
Poor boy was flogged...

255
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,310
and I escaped justice.

256
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,104
When I was 12,

257
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,560
I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

258
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,451
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

259
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,237
I skinned my sausage.

260
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,490
I made the bald man cry

261
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,534
into the turtle stew,

262
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,536
which I do believe my sister ate.

263
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,538
At least I hope she did.

264
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,916
Once I brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

265
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,255
Silence!

266
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,586
What happened next?

267
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,872
What do you think you're doing?

268
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,515
Confessing my crimes.

269
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,801
Lord Tyrion,

270
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,397
You are accused

271
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:56,890
of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,

272
00:25:57,418 --> 00:25:59,642
and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband

273
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:03,479
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

274
00:26:04,085 --> 00:26:05,535
I'm very sorry.

275
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,818
I don't know anything about all that.

276
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,092
You've had your little joke.

277
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,193
I trust you enjoyed it.

278
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,660
Take him back to the dungeon.

279
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,122
But this time find a smaller cell,
with a steeper floor.

280
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,959
Is this how justice

281
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,920
is done in the Vale?

282
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,505
You accuse me of crimes,

283
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:30,910
I deny them,

284
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:34,594
so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and starve?

285
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,654
Where is the King's Justice?

286
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,891
I am accused and demand a trial!

287
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,707
If you're tried and found guilty,

288
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:46,981
then by the King's own laws
you will pay with your life.

289
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,407
I understand the law.

290
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,656
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

291
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,324
Life is more elegant here.

292
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,745
Open the moon door.

293
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,891
You want a trial, My Lord Lannister.

294
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,087
Very well.

295
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,980
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

296
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,951
and you will hear his judgment.

297
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,082
Then you will leave...

298
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:33,730
By one door or the other.

299
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:35,363
No need to bother Lord Robin.

300
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,158
I demand a trial by combat.

301
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,837
You have that right.

302
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,923
I beg the honor.

303
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:55,925
Let me be your champion.

304
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,385
The honor should be mine.

305
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,513
For the love I bore
your Lord husband,

306
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,640
let me avenge his death.

307
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,559
- I'll fight for you.
- It'll be my honor.

308
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,081
The honor should be mine.

309
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:08,271
Make the bad man fly!

310
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:11,614
Ser Vardis...

311
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,526
You're quiet.

312
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,362
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

313
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,473
With all my heart, My Lady.

314
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,619
But the Imp is half my size.

315
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,205
It would be shameful to slaughter
such a man and call it justice.

316
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:28,374
Agreed.

317
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,847
You demanded a trial by combat.

318
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,713
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

319
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,344
I will gladly fight
the Imp's champion for you.

320
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,722
I wouldn't be too glad, Ser.

321
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,350
I name my brother Jaime Lannister.

322
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,520
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

323
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,023
Send a raven for him.
I'm happy to wait.

324
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,068
The trial will be today.

325
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:00,698
Do I have a volunteer?

326
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,499
Anyone?

327
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:12,513
Anyone?

328
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:18,383
I think we can assume
that no one is willing...

329
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,259
I'll stand for the dwarf.

330
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:33,898
More wine, Your Grace?

331
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:38,553
- What was I saying?
- Simpler time.

332
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:41,810
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

333
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:44,589
- Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?
- It was, Your Grace.

334
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:46,202
The enemy was right in the open,

335
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,775
vicious as you like,

336
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,628
all but sending you
a bloody invitation.

337
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,292
Nothing like today.

338
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,205
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

339
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,584
Not as exhilarating as those balls

340
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,262
and masquerades you like to throw.

341
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,474
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

342
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,197
Once. I think.

343
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:11,323
You think?

344
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,620
I think you'd remember.

345
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:16,890
Back in our day,
you weren't a real man

346
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,736
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

347
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,982
and the Riverlands.

348
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:24,861
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some lucky girls.

349
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:26,492
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

350
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:29,203
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

351
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:31,626
Those were the days.

352
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:32,957
Which days, exactly?

353
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:36,511
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

354
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:39,884
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

355
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,717
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

356
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:46,044
Or way before that, when dragons
burned whole cities to the ground?

357
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:47,404
Easy, boy.

358
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,429
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the King.

359
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:53,321
I suppose it was all rather heroic...

360
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:55,696
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

361
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,399
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

362
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:04,405
More wine, Your Grace?

363
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,722
They burned most everything
in the Riverlands:

364
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:28,699
our fields; our granaries;

365
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:30,723
our homes.

366
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:34,905
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

367
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:36,938
When they was done,

368
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,549
they butchered them
as if they was animals.

369
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:41,859
They covered our children

370
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,026
in pitch

371
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:45,488
and lit them on fire.

372
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,783
Brigands, most likely.

373
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:51,244
They weren't thieves.

374
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:53,814
They didn't steal nothing.

375
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,590
They even left something behind,
Your Grace.

376
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,877
It's the King's Hand
you're addressing, not the King.

377
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,143
The King is hunting.

378
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,800
Fish. The Sigil of House Tully.

379
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,645
Isn't that your wife's house...
Tully, My Lord Hand?

380
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,484
These men,

381
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,353
were they flying a Sigil?

382
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,072
A banner?

383
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,658
None, your... Hand.

384
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,202
The one who was leading them...

385
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,747
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

386
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:39,787
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

387
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,545
saw him take the head off a horse

388
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,547
with a single swing of his sword.

389
00:32:45,335 --> 00:32:47,137
That sounds like someone we know.

390
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,093
The Mountain.

391
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,888
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

392
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:56,517
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

393
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,165
The man is an anointed knight.

394
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,243
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

395
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,028
I'm sure you have as well.

396
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,428
Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

397
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,113
for being angry with your wife?

398
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,824
If the Lannisters

399
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,171
were to order attacks on villages

400
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:16,403
under the King's protection,

401
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:17,455
it would be...

402
00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:19,219
That would be almost as brazen

403
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:22,293
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

404
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,968
I cannot give you back your homes

405
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,638
or restore your dead to life,

406
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,681
but perhaps I can give you justice

407
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,267
in the name of our King, Robert.

408
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,561
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

409
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:47,401
You shall have the command.

410
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:49,487
Assemble 100 men

411
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,155
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

412
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:52,990
As you command.

413
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:03,368
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon, the first,

414
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:07,254
King of the Andals and the first men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

415
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,880
and protector of the realm,

416
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:13,219
I charge you to bring the King's Justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

417
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,471
and those who shared in his crimes.

418
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:19,141
I denounce him and attaint him.

419
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,646
I strip him of all ranks and titles,

420
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:27,358
of all lands and holdings,

421
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,256
and sentence him to death.

422
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:33,072
This is a drastic action.

423
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:36,575
It would be better
to wait for King Robert's return.

424
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,036
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My Lord.

425
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,107
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

426
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,834
Inform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to Court

427
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,871
to answer for the crimes
of his bannermen.

428
00:34:46,996 --> 00:34:51,090
He will arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown

429
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,050
and a traitor to the realm.

430
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,767
A bold move, My Lord, and admirable.

431
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:13,320
But is it wise
to yank the lion's tail?

432
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,446
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

433
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:20,772
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

434
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,064
Then how come Robert is King

435
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:25,321
and not Tywin Lannister?

436
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,588
Stand and fight, coward!

437
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,585
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

438
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:42,905
Is it over?

439
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,995
You don't fight with honor!

440
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:58,337
He did.

441
00:39:12,631 --> 00:39:14,103
Can I make the little man fly now?

442
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:17,481
Not this little man.
This little man is going home.

443
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,444
I believe you have something of mine.

444
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,356
A Lannister always pays his debts.

445
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:07,077
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

446
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:09,920
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

447
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,393
It's important to remember where
you come from.

448
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,999
I'm not sure your mother
would like these new styles.

449
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,460
My mother isn't from the North.

450
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,556
I'm aware of that.

451
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,631
Why do you care?

452
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,383
Do you even have hair under there?

453
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,984
- I have hair.
- I've never seen it.

454
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:32,723
Would you like to?

455
00:40:37,863 --> 00:40:40,586
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

456
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,153
- I come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.

457
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:48,655
I just realized I don't care.

458
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:51,058
- Sansa...
- Septa.

459
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,203
Now you are being rude.

460
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,044
My prince.

461
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:07,772
My Lady.

462
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,011
I fear I have behaved monstrously

463
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:13,143
the past few weeks.

464
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:18,250
With your permission?

465
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:32,911
It's beautiful,

466
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,244
like the one your mother wears.

467
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,955
You'll be Queen someday.

468
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,624
It's only fitting
you should look the part.

469
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:47,923
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

470
00:41:49,124 --> 00:41:50,759
There's nothing to forgive.

471
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,193
You're My Lady.

472
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,493
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

473
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,521
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

474
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,815
from the last hearth in the North

475
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,335
to the Salt Shore in the South,

476
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,863
and you will be Queen
over all of them.

477
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:16,702
I'll never disrespect you again.

478
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,223
I'll never be cruel to you again.

479
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,180
Do you understand me?

480
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:25,801
You're My Lady now,

481
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:28,669
from this day

482
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,353
until my last day.

483
00:43:00,486 --> 00:43:03,332
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

484
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,500
In a turnip cart?

485
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,378
I'll find a ship heading
south in White Harbor.

486
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:10,839
You can afford that?

487
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:13,592
Some of my friends
are more generous than others.

488
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:16,845
There's a thousand like you there.

489
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,003
So I'll have lots of company.

490
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:22,643
Yes, you'll be very popular.
Until some fat lord comes to visit

491
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:24,821
with a big belly and a little prick

492
00:43:24,946 --> 00:43:27,315
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

493
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,212
And what will happen
to me if I stay here?

494
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:31,944
Will I become Lady Greyjoy?

495
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,030
- Mistress of the Iron Islands?
- Don't be a fool.

496
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:39,034
Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.

497
00:43:39,863 --> 00:43:42,913
Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching off to war soon.

498
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,792
Most of them will never come back.
There's nothing left for me here.

499
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,461
Let's go, Stefon.

500
00:43:52,206 --> 00:43:54,049
Let me see it one more time!

501
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,921
See what?

502
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,579
I'm going to miss you.

503
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:11,692
I know.

504
00:44:26,004 --> 00:44:28,250
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

505
00:44:29,017 --> 00:44:31,503
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

506
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:34,798
- Is that why you're sending us home?
- Please, father.

507
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:38,115
You can't.
I've got my lessons with Syrio.

508
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,523
- I'm finally getting good.
- This isn't a punishment.

509
00:44:42,386 --> 00:44:45,613
- I want you back for your own safety.
- Can we take Syrio back with us?

510
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:48,353
Who cares about your dancing teacher?
I can't go.

511
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:53,108
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen

512
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,235
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

513
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,031
When you're old enough, I'll make you
a match with someone worthy of you,

514
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,367
brave, gentle and strong...

515
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,203
I don't want someone brave,
gentle and strong. I want him!

516
00:45:05,794 --> 00:45:07,956
He'll be the greatest King ever,
a golden lion,

517
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,667
and I'll give him
sons with beautiful blond hair.

518
00:45:11,894 --> 00:45:13,920
The lion's not his sigil, idiot.

519
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:16,298
He's a stag, like his father.

520
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,550
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk King.

521
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,776
Go on, get your Septa
and start packing your things.

522
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:27,225
- Come on.
- But it's not fair!

523
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:05,057
"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."

524
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:09,937
"Axel Baratheon, black of hair."

525
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:13,949
"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair."

526
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:18,033
"Steffon Baratheon, black of hair."

527
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,148
"Robert Baratheon, black of hair."

528
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:30,572
"Joffrey Baratheon...

529
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:33,091
Golden-haired."

530
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:12,164
- Where's my sister?
- Stop him.

531
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:14,249
Where is she?

532
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,506
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

533
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:24,968
- The whore's feast?
- Come.

534
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,720
Get your hands off me!

535
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,142
No one touches the Dragon!

536
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,569
I'm here for the feast.

537
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:49,868
Khal Drogo says
there is a place for you.

538
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:51,984
Back there.

539
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:56,583
That is no place for a King.

540
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:59,169
You are no King.

541
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:03,715
Keep away from me!

542
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,638
There she is.

543
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:17,216
Put the sword down.
They'll kill us all.

544
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:18,791
They can't kill us.

545
00:48:20,788 --> 00:48:23,856
They can't shed blood
in their sacred city.

546
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,077
But I can.

547
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,404
I want what I came for.

548
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,675
I want the crown he promised me.

549
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,217
He bought you.

550
00:48:49,342 --> 00:48:50,762
But he never paid for you.

551
00:48:57,294 --> 00:48:59,896
Tell him I want what was bargained for
or I'm taking you back.

552
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,760
He can keep the baby.

553
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,902
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

554
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:22,377
What's he saying?

555
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:25,547
He says yes.

556
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:29,884
You shall have a golden crown...

557
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:34,154
That men shall tremble to behold.

558
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,252
That was all I wanted.

559
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,512
What was promised.

560
00:50:15,274 --> 00:50:16,727
You cannot touch me.

561
00:50:16,852 --> 00:50:18,975
I am the Dragon.
I'm a dragon!

562
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,884
I want my crown!

563
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,698
Look away, Khaleesi.

564
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,463
Dany, tell them.
Make them!

565
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,132
Make them...

566
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,418
No, you can't!

567
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:00,975
Dany, please!

568
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:06,231
A crown for a King.

569
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:25,638
He was no Dragon.

570
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,506
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.

571
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,676
