2
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:16,183
Here we are.

3
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:26,260
Ready?

4
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,434
"The Rains of Castamere."

5
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,519
You fucking deaf?

6
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,855
Same wrong guess
every fucking time.

7
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,273
Listen, you cunt.

8
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,492
Oh!

9
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,414
"The Bear
and the Maiden Fair."

10
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,117
There's a man with an ear.

11
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:52,536
Too bad you got
a hangnail for a cock.

12
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,507
First time I saw you
with your breeches down,

13
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,209
I thought you were a eunuch.

14
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,761
You've seen it, girls.

15
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:03,714
Like a baby snail
peeking out of his shell.

16
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,147
Your baby was crying
this morning.

17
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:28,072
Woke me up.

18
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,790
You hear me?

19
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,292
Yes.

20
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,744
Well, got anything to say?

21
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,746
I'm sorry he woke you up.

22
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,966
I don't
care if you're sorry.

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,752
Keep that baby quiet

24
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,554
or I will.

25
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,139
Don't you ever touch him.

26
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,426
Little wildling bitch.

27
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:52,513
<i>You should have stayed</i>
<i>with your own kind.</i>

28
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,317
<i>You listening to me?</i>

29
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,352
- Shut your mouth.
- What?

30
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,240
It's just an owl,
you dumb bitch.

31
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,526
No, it's not.

32
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:45,709
- - Shh.

33
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,419
I should never
have left her there.

34
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:59,056
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've known.

35
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,609
They've been raiding
the villages close by.

36
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,445
And we just cower in here while
they slaughter our brothers.

37
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,280
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

38
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:08,899
So it's all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs

39
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,784
and Mully chopped to pieces
'cause they broke the rules?

40
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,319
<i> I didn't
say it was all right.</i>

41
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,038
I'm saying they shouldn't
have been there.

42
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,573
We're pledged to guard
the realms of men.

43
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,075
She's dead because of me.

44
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,638
We can't even guard Mole's Town.

45
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,245
We can't go after them.
You know that.

46
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,746
It's what they want.

47
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,082
And little Sam.

48
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:28,135
As if I cut their throats myself.

49
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,503
Maybe she managed
to hide herself.

50
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,422
<i>I thought all of you was dead.</i>

51
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,757
You went north with Mormont
and no one came back.

52
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,843
Not for ages.

53
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,761
But then you did.

54
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,148
She survived Craster

55
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,734
and he was the worst
shit I've ever met.

56
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,436
She survived the long march
to the Wall.

57
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,273
<i>She survived a white walker,</i>
<i>for fuck's sake.</i>

58
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:51,992
She might have got out.

59
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,747
She might have.

60
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,451
If they hit Mole's Town,

61
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,536
then we're next.

62
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,541
Mance and his army
must be close.

63
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,259
<i>100,000 of them.</i>

64
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,795
And there's what,
105 of us left?

65
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:14,465
You counting Black Jack,
Kegs, and Mully?

66
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:17,634
102.

67
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:20,804
How do 102 men stop 100,000?

68
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,311
Whoever dies last, be a good lad

69
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:29,813
<i>and burn the rest of us.</i>

70
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,449
Once I'm done with this world,

71
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,952
I don't want to come back.

72
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,653
<i> You think
he was spying on you?</i>

73
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:39,288
<i>No, not spying.</i>

74
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,573
<i> The Dothraki think
outsiders are ridiculous</i>

75
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,075
taking shame in the naked body.

76
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:46,462
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

77
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:50,165
Yes, Your Grace.

78
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,501
But you are not Dothraki.

79
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,503
No.

80
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,840
Well, I don't see
why it matters.

81
00:08:57,891 --> 00:08:59,141
Grey Worm isn't interested.

82
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,695
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

83
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,015
He was interested.

84
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,601
What?

85
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:14,106
I believe he was interested.

86
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,993
When the slavers
castrate the boys,

87
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:19,745
do they take all of it?

88
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,864
All of it?

89
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,832
The--

90
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,618
the pillar and the stones.

91
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,373
I don't know, Your Grace.

92
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,126
Haven't you ever wondered?

93
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,965
Yes, Your Grace.

94
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,558
<i>Missandei.</i>

95
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:05,836
_

96
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:08,156
_

97
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,960
_

98
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,313
_

99
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,786
The lessons you give I
in common tongue...

100
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,641
these are precious to I.

101
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,927
- To me.
- To me.

102
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:28,096
I don't remember teaching
you the word precious.

103
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:31,233
Jorah the Andal,
he teaches I--

104
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:34,069
he teaches me this word.

105
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:37,773
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

106
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:40,609
I remember nothing.

107
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:42,494
Only Unsullied.

108
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:44,529
When they cut you,

109
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:46,999
do you remember that?

110
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:51,420
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,672
I'm sorry they did that to you.

112
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:56,425
Why?
Why sorry?

113
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,127
It's a terrible thing
to do to a boy.

114
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:06,718
If the masters never cut me,

115
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,854
I never am Unsullied.

116
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:14,647
I never stand in
the Plaza of Pride

117
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,565
when Daenerys Stormborn ordered us
to kill the masters.

118
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:20,386
I never am chosen
to lead the Unsullied.

119
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,655
I never meet Missandei

120
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,990
from the island of Naath.

121
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,976
I am sorry I--

122
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,513
for today.

123
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,682
I am sorry.

124
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,857
_

125
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,555
_

126
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,276
_

127
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,696
Kraken. Mmm.

128
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:40,366
Strong as long
as they're in the sea.

129
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,068
When you take them
out of the water,

130
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,403
no bones.

131
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,655
They collapse
under their proud weight

132
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:49,074
and slump into
a heap of nothing.

133
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,326
You'd think they know that.

134
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,962
Unfortunately,
they're not very bright.

135
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,466
What do you tell them?

136
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,752
I'm Theon Greyjoy,

137
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:02,554
son of Balon,
heir to the Iron Islands.

138
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:05,758
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

139
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,810
Are you sure?

140
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,730
You do look very much
like a lord.

141
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:15,017
Formidable, proud.

142
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,603
I'm Reek.

143
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:19,488
Until when?

144
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,573
Always.

145
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:23,826
- Forever.
- That's right.

146
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,246
Until you're rotting
in the ground.

147
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,869
Remember what you are
and what you're not.

148
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,338
Bring me Moat Cailin.

149
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,403
No closer.

150
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:13,075
Who are you?

151
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,699
I'm Kenning,

152
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,951
commander of this garrison.

153
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,755
And you say
you're Theon Greyjoy?

154
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:01,707
Yes.

155
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,793
And why should I believe that?

156
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:07,846
I was born on Pyke
to Balon Greyjoy.

157
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:10,599
His third and last living son.

158
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,351
I am your prince.

159
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,603
I swear it by the Drowned God.

160
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,972
What is dead may never die.

161
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:19,057
What is dead may never die.

162
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,360
And if you were my prince,

163
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,695
why are you marching
with a Bolton army?

164
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,281
Lord Bolton took me
captive after Winterfell.

165
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:29,284
He sent me to treat
with you in good faith

166
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,736
as your fellow ironborn.

167
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:32,899
And what does Lord Bolton want?

168
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,626
You are fading from sickness,

169
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,127
you are badly outnumbered,

170
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,463
and you're hundreds
of miles from the sea.

171
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,415
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men

172
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,969
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

173
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:50,422
Do this, and he will be
just and fair with you

174
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:52,391
as he has been with me.

175
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,346
The Boltons will give you safe
passage to the Stony Shore.

176
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:59,598
He wants us to surrender?

177
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,351
My own father, your king,

178
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:05,687
surrendered years ago
to Robert Baratheon.

179
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,990
I watched him bend the knee.

180
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,608
There was no shame there.

181
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,327
He fought with honor,
as did you.

182
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,667
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

183
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,586
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

184
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,507
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

185
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:31,797
Only a whipped dog
would speak this way.

186
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,550
Or a woman.

187
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,804
Are you a woman, boy?

188
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:40,305
You don't know--

189
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,641
The ironborn will not surrender.

190
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,359
Reek. My name is Reek...

191
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,645
You go tell your master that,

192
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:48,981
Theon Greyjoy,

193
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,983
or whoever the fuck you are.

194
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,701
My name is Reek.

195
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,369
What in the hell
are you muttering?

196
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,288
I'm Reek.

197
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,207
Reek.

198
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:07,883
If we yield, we live?

199
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,885
Is that what it says
on this paper here?

200
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,172
Yes. Have your men raise the
white flag and open the gates.

201
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,642
You're going home.

202
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,851
<i> You didn't really think
I'd let them go, did you?</i>

203
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:29,655
It's fallen out
of fashion, flaying.

204
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:31,907
Sad, but true.

205
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,942
Traditions are important.

206
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:36,278
Where are we
without our history?

207
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,780
- Eh?
- Yes, my lord.

208
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,366
Will we go home now?

209
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:44,536
I believe we will.

210
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,538
To our new home.

211
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:59,685
<i>You have foreign
blood, don't you, Baelish?</i>

212
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:03,221
A great-grandfather
from Braavos, yes.

213
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:05,807
I suppose all of our ancestors

214
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,809
came from somewhere
else originally.

215
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,062
<i> Our forebearers
settled the Vale</i>

216
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:11,530
<i>thousands of years ago.</i>

217
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:14,066
<i>We've fought off invaders</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

218
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:15,567
The beauty of the Vale
is matched only

219
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,986
by the nobility
of its great families.

220
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:20,122
Lady Arryn often told me

221
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,741
that you were her rock,
Lord Royce.

222
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,594
She told me nothing
about you, Baelish.

223
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:28,363
But I didn't need
to hear from her.

224
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,532
Moneylender.
Whoremonger.

225
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,568
You've been licking Tywin
Lannister's boots so long,

226
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,554
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord--

227
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:39,391
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

228
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,309
Always been a grubby job.

229
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,562
Why not let a grubby man do it?

230
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:46,164
<i>But when I heard</i>
<i>you were lurking here,</i>

231
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:48,033
fawning over
the Lady Arryn--

232
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,152
Lady Arryn invited me.

233
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:52,938
She and I have been
close since childhood.

234
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,524
Yes, we all know
how close you were.

235
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,376
<i>Lady Arryn's predilections</i>
<i>were her own affair.</i>

236
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:00,028
Her death is our affair.

237
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,831
Of course. Her suicide
shattered us all.

238
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:05,250
She was an odd fish.

239
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:08,003
Everyone knew that.
But suicide?

240
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:11,506
<i>She adored that boy of hers.</i>

241
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,925
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

242
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,095
<i>Strange that within
days of your arrival,</i>

243
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,466
you've married Lady Arryn and she's
fallen through the Moon Door.

244
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:23,552
She was always prone
to melancholy.

245
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:27,105
My lady wasn't meant for a
world as brutal as ours.

246
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,191
We were told there was a witness.
A girl.

247
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:31,560
A niece of yours, I believe.

248
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:35,981
A girl with no learning
and scattered wits.

249
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:37,315
I assure you,
she would be of no help.

250
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,484
We'd like to speak with her.

251
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,872
- Let me fetch her.
<i>-  No need.</i>

252
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:48,160
We prefer to hear her
testimony unadulterated.

253
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:59,754
<i>Come closer, child.</i>

254
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:03,175
You have nothing
to fear from us or him.

255
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:06,728
<i>Lord Baelish here is your uncle?</i>

256
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,147
<i>Your name is Alayne?</i>

257
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,019
<i>Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.</i>

258
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,854
- My lady--
- I wasn't asking you.

259
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:19,074
- He can stay. - Speak up, girl, you're not
a damn kitchen mouse.

260
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,193
Tell us what you saw.

261
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,581
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

262
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,500
I have to tell the truth.

263
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,457
I'll tell you everything.

264
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:39,928
Please, Alayne,
leave nothing out.

265
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:44,049
My name is not Alayne.

266
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:46,551
It's Sansa Stark,

267
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:49,221
eldest daughter
of Lord Eddard Stark.

268
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:51,890
Lord Royce, we met when
you came to Winterfell.

269
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,726
You were escorting your son
Ser Waymar to the Wall.

270
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:57,979
Sansa Stark?

271
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,233
You tell lies right to my
face, you little worm?

272
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:04,452
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

273
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:09,241
All to protect me.

274
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,544
<i>Since my father was executed,</i>

275
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:15,463
I have been a hostage
in King's Landing.

276
00:21:15,498 --> 00:21:18,300
A plaything for Joffrey
to torture

277
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,502
or Queen Cersei to torment.

278
00:21:20,553 --> 00:21:23,171
They beat me,
they humiliated me,

279
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:26,091
they married me to the Imp.

280
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:28,977
I had no friends
in King's Landing...

281
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,847
except one.

282
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:41,106
He saved me.

283
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:44,526
Smuggled me away
when he had the chance.

284
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:48,496
He knew I'd be safe
here in the Eyrie

285
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:51,166
with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

286
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:55,754
The Lannisters have
friends everywhere.

287
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:57,038
<i>Even the Vale.</i>

288
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,292
<i>He made me swear not to
tell anyone my true name.</i>

289
00:22:00,294 --> 00:22:03,128
Your secret is safe
with us, my lady.

290
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,764
<i>Your father grew up
right here in these halls.</i>

291
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:07,966
We hunted together many times.

292
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:09,467
He was a fine man.

293
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:14,189
Tell us what happened
to your aunt, Sansa.

294
00:22:16,142 --> 00:22:19,194
You knew her well,
my lords, my lady.

295
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:21,563
You knew she was
a troubled woman.

296
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:24,399
She always loved Lord Baelish.

297
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,151
She told me herself.

298
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:28,703
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

299
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:33,458
a boy of eight carrying everything
he owned in a little sack.

300
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:37,963
<i>She confessed to me</i>
<i>she never loved Lord Arryn.</i>

301
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:41,483
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

302
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:45,503
<i>When the gods finally allowed</i>
<i>her to be with Lord Baelish,</i>

303
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:47,222
she was so happy.

304
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:48,707
For a time.

305
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:52,844
My aunt was a jealous lady.

306
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,649
She was terrified
that Lord Baelish

307
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:58,933
didn't love her anymore.

308
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:01,519
That he would abandon
her for a younger woman.

309
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,992
And then...

310
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:10,362
one day she saw him kiss me.

311
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,030
Lady Sansa.

312
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:15,200
It was a peck on the cheek,
Lord Royce, nothing more.

313
00:23:15,202 --> 00:23:18,870
Lord Baelish is my uncle
now, in truth, by marriage.

314
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:21,873
He's always been so kind to me.

315
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,759
I was so happy to be here,
to be free.

316
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,928
All because of him.

317
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:29,214
But my aunt turned on me.

318
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:32,600
She cursed me.
Called me a whore.

319
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:35,353
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

320
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:37,806
When Lord Baelish tried
to calm her,

321
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:39,691
she struck him.

322
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:41,393
She said she didn't want
to live anymore.

323
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,561
<i>She stood on the edge</i>
<i>of that Moon Door.</i>

324
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,364
He tried to reason with her.

325
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:47,899
Promised her she was the
only one he had ever loved,

326
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:52,570
but she stepped through
those doors and she was--

327
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,908
Shh.

328
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,795
Shh, it's not your fault,
sweet girl.

329
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:08,386
It's not your fault.

330
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:26,009
You could see it in the
way she raised that boy.

331
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,940
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

332
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:32,026
Lord Royce!
This is hardly the time.

333
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:33,778
Apologies, my lady.

334
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:35,613
And to you as well, Baelish.

335
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:37,532
We treated you a bit harshly.

336
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,367
You want justice, Lord Royce.

337
00:24:39,418 --> 00:24:40,919
I can hardly
complain about that.

338
00:24:40,953 --> 00:24:42,754
I want the same.

339
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:47,425
Not much justice to be meted
out in suicide, is there?

340
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,761
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

341
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:51,930
Only 20 years ago,
the knights of the Vale

342
00:24:51,964 --> 00:24:55,216
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

343
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:58,937
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

344
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:00,805
And since then, Arryn and Royce,

345
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,474
Corbray, Waynwood,

346
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:05,693
all the great houses of the
Vale watched from the corner.

347
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:07,529
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

348
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:10,064
Are you questioning our courage?

349
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:12,984
I want to know
which side you're on.

350
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:14,536
Do you support the Lannisters,

351
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,690
the house that executed
your friend Ned Stark?

352
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,990
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

353
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:22,961
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support and Lysa refused.

354
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:25,964
By staying out of the fray,
you've allowed Tywin Lannister

355
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,500
to destroy his rivals
on every compass point.

356
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:30,001
Who stands against him now?

357
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:32,670
Who would you have
us back, Lord Baelish?

358
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:34,472
Robb Stark is dead.

359
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:37,091
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

360
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,810
Lord of the Vale.

361
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:40,812
Robin Arryn is
a sickly little boy.

362
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:44,265
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

363
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:46,351
More often they die young.

364
00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:48,937
I adored Lysa with all my heart.

365
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:52,907
But she loved her son so much,
she became overprotective.

366
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,693
He needs to learn
how to swing a sword.

367
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:57,078
How to ride a horse.

368
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:59,948
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes, it's time.

369
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,866
Time for him to tour the Vale,

370
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:04,369
to visit all the castles
in his domain.

371
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,789
Time for Robin
to leave the nest.

372
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:29,527
<i>Ser Barristan.</i>

373
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:31,396
Yes?

374
00:26:32,698 --> 00:26:34,449
Who sent you?

375
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:12,353
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

376
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:15,189
Have I forgotten
a council meeting?

377
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,492
No.

378
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:28,036
What's this?

379
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:29,587
A royal pardon

380
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:32,206
signed by Robert Baratheon.

381
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:48,022
You spied on her.

382
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:51,559
Who gave you this?

383
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,978
Does it matter?

384
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:04,205
Have you told her?

385
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,541
I wanted to tell you
first, man-to-man

386
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:09,544
rather than go behind your back.

387
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,832
Let me speak
with her in private.

388
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:17,168
You'll never be alone
with her again.

389
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:56,457
Why did the usurper pardon you?

390
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,094
If we could speak alone.

391
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:03,513
No, speak to me here.

392
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:06,066
Explain it to me.

393
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,184
Who do you think
sent this to Meereen?

394
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:10,019
Who profits?

395
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:12,188
This is the work
of Tywin Lannister.

396
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,023
He wants to divide us.

397
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,743
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

398
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:19,746
The pardon was signed
the year we met.

399
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:23,166
Why were you pardoned?

400
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,535
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

401
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:29,956
It is not forged.

402
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,008
Why, then?

403
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:33,760
I sent letters to Varys,

404
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:36,012
the spymaster of King's Landing.

405
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,465
What was the content
of these letters?

406
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:40,917
- Information.
- What information?

407
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,887
When you and Viserys
arrived in Pentos.

408
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:46,389
His plan to marry you
to Khal Drogo.

409
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:48,691
<i>When you were married.</i>

410
00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:50,443
When your brother died.

411
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,946
You told him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

412
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,564
- I--
- Yes or no?

413
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:55,899
- Khaleesi.
-<i> Don't call me that.</i>

414
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,235
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

415
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:03,406
Yes.

416
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,244
That wine merchant
tried to poison me

417
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:09,829
because of your information.

418
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,664
I stopped you
from drinking his wine.

419
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,633
Because you knew it was poisoned.

420
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,002
I suspected.

421
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:18,421
You betrayed me

422
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:20,640
from the first.

423
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:23,510
Forgive me.

424
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,762
I never meant--

425
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:28,097
please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

426
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,817
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

427
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:32,819
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you.

428
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:34,237
Fought for you.
Killed for you.

429
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:35,832
...and you want me
to forgive you?

430
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:39,776
I have loved you.

431
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,778
Love?

432
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,614
Love? How can you
say that to me?

433
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:47,617
<i>Any other man, and I
would have you executed.</i>

434
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:50,920
But you, I do not want you
in my city dead or alive.

435
00:30:50,955 --> 00:30:54,340
Go back to your masters
in King's Landing.

436
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,926
Collect your pardon if you can.

437
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:01,631
Daenerys, please.

438
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:05,218
Don't ever presume
to touch me again

439
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,636
or speak my name.

440
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,438
You have until dusk
to collect your things

441
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:09,806
and leave this city.

442
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:12,809
<i>If you're found in Meereen</i>
<i>past break of day,</i>

443
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:15,478
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

444
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:19,649
Go.

445
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:23,052
Now.

446
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:21,094
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

447
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:30,219
Walk with me.

448
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:31,804
Has there been
any word from Locke?

449
00:32:31,855 --> 00:32:33,940
No.

450
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:35,224
Unimportant.

451
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:37,277
A cripple, a young boy.

452
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:40,363
None of the northern
lords have seen them.

453
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:43,366
Dead most likely.

454
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:48,071
Most of the ironborn
have fled the North.

455
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:52,075
Now more will follow,
thanks to you.

456
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:56,746
Tell me what you see.

457
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:03,753
Moors, fields, hills.

458
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,756
Tell me what you see.

459
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:13,179
Nothing.

460
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,764
Not nothing.

461
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:17,183
The North.

462
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,986
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

463
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,855
400 miles that way.

464
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,941
300 miles that way.

465
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:28,861
The North is larger than the
other six kingdoms combined.

466
00:33:28,912 --> 00:33:30,747
And I am the Warden
of the North.

467
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:33,282
The North is mine.

468
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,537
Now tell me, what is your name?

469
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,459
Ramsay Snow.

470
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,628
No, not Ramsay Snow.

471
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,631
Open it.

472
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,801
From this day
until your last day,

473
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:53,519
you are Ramsay Bolton,

474
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:56,472
son of Roose Bolton,
Warden of the North.

475
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,864
You honor me.

476
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:07,900
I swear I will uphold your name

477
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,902
and your tradition.

478
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:12,321
I will be worthy of you, Father,

479
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:14,741
I promise.

480
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,846
Come, Reek, I'll
be needing a bath.

481
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,460
Yes?

482
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,292
<i>First time I saw you,</i>
<i>you were just a child.</i>

483
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:26,596
<i>A girl from the North come to
the capital for the first time.</i>

484
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,332
Not a child any longer.

485
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,837
Why did you help me?

486
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:37,240
They would have thrown you
through the Moon Door

487
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:38,908
if they found you guilty.

488
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,494
<i>That's not an answer.</i>

489
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:46,249
If they'd have executed you,

490
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:47,750
what would they
have done with me?

491
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:51,087
I don't know.

492
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:53,589
Neither do I.

493
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,759
Better to gamble
on the man you know

494
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,561
than the strangers you don't?

495
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:02,598
And you think you know me?

496
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:05,985
I know what you want.

497
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:07,904
<i>Do you?</i>

498
00:36:23,504 --> 00:36:25,037
I thought
it'd make me happy,

499
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:27,039
but it doesn't.
Not really.

500
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,125
Nothing makes you happy.

501
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:30,793
- Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

502
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:32,845
Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

503
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,098
So you're sad because you didn't
get to kill Joffrey yourself.

504
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,383
Is that it?

505
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:38,968
At least I could
have been there to watch.

506
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:42,021
I wanted to see the look in his
eyes when he knew it was over.

507
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:45,441
Aye, nothing in the world
beats that look.

508
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:47,977
You protected him
for most of his life.

509
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:49,395
You think you
could have saved him?

510
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:52,465
I wasn't the damn wine taster.

511
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:58,788
Little shit deserved
to die, but poison--

512
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:01,657
poison's a woman's weapon.

513
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,543
Men kill with steel.

514
00:37:03,577 --> 00:37:05,044
That's your stupid
pride talking.

515
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:07,413
It's why you'll never
be a great killer.

516
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:10,249
I'd have killed Joffrey with
a chicken bone if I had to.

517
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:14,804
I'd pay good money to see that.

518
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:20,560
You should have let me burn it.

519
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:23,095
It's a fleabite.

520
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:26,566
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

521
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,902
Well, we won't have to
walk too much further.

522
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:31,854
You really think my
aunt will pay for me?

523
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,489
Aye, she'll pay.

524
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:34,857
I've never even met her.

525
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:38,327
Doesn't matter.
You're her blood.

526
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:42,949
Family, honor,
all that horseshit.

527
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,534
It's all you lords
and ladies ever talk about.

528
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:47,753
I'm not a lady.

529
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:51,040
Who would
pass the Bloody Gate?

530
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:54,377
The bloody Hound,
Sandor Clegane.

531
00:37:54,428 --> 00:37:56,712
And his...

532
00:37:56,714 --> 00:37:59,715
traveling companion Arya Stark,

533
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:02,718
<i>niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.</i>

534
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,638
Then I offer my condolences.

535
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:07,974
Lady Arryn died.

536
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:13,229
Three days ago.

537
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:33,416
I've never left home
before, Uncle Petyr.

538
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:35,584
- I'm afraid to leave.
- You shouldn't be.

539
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:38,671
The Lord of the Vale belongs
in the Eyrie, Mother said.

540
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:41,223
She said it's not safe outside.

541
00:38:41,258 --> 00:38:42,975
It wasn't safe for her inside.

542
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,762
People die
at their dinner tables.

543
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,931
They die in their beds.

544
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:52,351
They die squatting
over their chamber pots.

545
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,770
Everybody dies sooner or later.

546
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,656
Don't worry about your death.

547
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,408
Worry about your life.

548
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,827
Take charge of your life

549
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:04,280
for as long as it lasts.

550
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:07,283
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

551
00:39:31,308 --> 00:39:33,309
Shall we go?

552
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:42,985
Wine always helps.

553
00:39:44,654 --> 00:39:47,123
I thank you for it.

554
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,493
Trial by combat.

555
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:54,964
Deciding a man's guilt
or innocence

556
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:57,166
in the eyes of the gods

557
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:59,835
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

558
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:02,638
Tells you something
about the gods.

559
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:06,675
How much longer?

560
00:40:06,727 --> 00:40:09,045
Soon.

561
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:14,216
Do you think
Oberyn has a chance?

562
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,188
The Red Viper of Dorne.

563
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,440
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

564
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:22,858
<i>I've never seen him fight.</i>

565
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:25,661
Oh, he's going to die.
I'm going to die.

566
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:26,996
Oberyn believes in himself.

567
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,081
That's putting it mildly.

568
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,284
What's the punishment
for regicide?

569
00:40:32,335 --> 00:40:35,121
Drawing and quartering?
Hanging?

570
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:37,506
-<i> Breaking at the wheel?</i>
- Beheading.

571
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,275
<i>Seems rather ordinary.</i>

572
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:41,811
<i>And he was my nephew</i>
<i>as well, so what is that?</i>

573
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,379
Fratricide is brothers.

574
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:45,548
Filicide is sons.

575
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,135
Nepoticide.
That's the one.

576
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:54,273
Matricide, patricide,

577
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:57,193
infanticide, suicide.

578
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:01,147
There's no kind of killing that
doesn't have its own word.

579
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:03,065
Cousins.

580
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,167
<i>Cousins, you're right.</i>

581
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:06,902
There is no word
for cousin killing.

582
00:41:06,953 --> 00:41:08,737
Well done.

583
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:11,869
Do you remember cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

584
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,160
Of course. Wet-nurse
dropped him on his head.

585
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:16,796
- Left him simple.
-<i> Simple?</i>

586
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,881
Used to sit all day
in the garden.

587
00:41:18,915 --> 00:41:20,666
Crushing beetles with a rock.

588
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:26,589
Nothing made him happier.

589
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,973
Nothing made you happier.

590
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,892
You'd think being
tormented from birth

591
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:32,094
would have given you some
affinity for the afflicted.

592
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:35,314
On the contrary. Laughing
at another person's misery

593
00:41:35,348 --> 00:41:37,316
was the only thing that made
me feel like everyone else.

594
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,235
The joke wore thin, though.

595
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,153
<i>For you.</i>
<i>You drifted away.</i>

596
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,855
I had other interests.

597
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,907
Yes, other interests.

598
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,777
But I stayed with Orson.

599
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:50,779
<i>Why?</i>

600
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,248
I was curious.

601
00:41:52,282 --> 00:41:54,617
Why was he smashing
all those beetles?

602
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:56,218
What did he get out of it?

603
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:58,337
<i>First thing I did was ask him.</i>

604
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:02,124
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

605
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,177
He gave me an answer.
"Smash the beetles.

606
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:08,130
Smash 'em."

607
00:42:09,266 --> 00:42:10,933
<i>I wasn't deterred.</i>

608
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,635
I was the smartest
person I knew.

609
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:15,221
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

610
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:16,939
that lay at the heart
of a moron.

611
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:20,526
So I went to
Maester Volarik's library.

612
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,728
Volarik.
Tried to touch me once.

613
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:25,281
Turns out, far too much has
been written about great men

614
00:42:25,315 --> 00:42:27,483
and not nearly enough
about morons.

615
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:29,818
Doesn't seem right.

616
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,787
In any case, I found nothing

617
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:33,822
that illuminated the nature
of Orson's affliction

618
00:42:33,824 --> 00:42:36,659
or the reason behind his
relentless beetle slaughter.

619
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:39,028
<i>So I went back to the source.</i>

620
00:42:39,062 --> 00:42:41,230
<i>I may not have been able</i>
<i>to speak with Orson,</i>

621
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:43,883
but I could observe him,
watch him

622
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,168
the way men watch animals

623
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,250
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behavior.

624
00:42:51,892 --> 00:42:53,259
And as I watched,

625
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,811
I became more and more
sure of it.

626
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:58,480
There was something
happening there.

627
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:01,734
His face was like
the page of a book

628
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:03,686
written in a language
I didn't understand.

629
00:43:03,737 --> 00:43:06,572
But he wasn't mindless.
He had his reasons.

630
00:43:06,606 --> 00:43:09,858
<i>And I became possessed</i>
<i>with knowing what they were.</i>

631
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,445
I began to spend inordinate
amounts of time watching him.

632
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:16,115
I would eat my lunch
in the garden,

633
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,250
chewing my mutton
to the music of...

634
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:22,871
And when I wasn't watching
him, I was thinking about him.

635
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:25,674
Father droned on about
the family legacy

636
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:27,443
<i>and I thought about</i>
<i>Orson's beetles.</i>

637
00:43:27,477 --> 00:43:30,346
I read the histories
of Targaryen conquests.

638
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,548
Did I hear dragon wings?
No.

639
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:35,551
I heard...

640
00:43:35,602 --> 00:43:39,355
<i>And I still couldn't figure</i>
<i>out why he was doing it.</i>

641
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:41,690
And I had to know,
because it was horrible

642
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:45,060
that all these beetles should
be dying for no reason.

643
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,645
Every day around the world,

644
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:50,065
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

645
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:52,901
Who gives a dusty fuck
about a bunch of beetles?

646
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:55,738
I know, I know. But still,
it filled me with dread.

647
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:59,325
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

648
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:01,210
How many countless living
crawling things

649
00:44:01,244 --> 00:44:04,213
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

650
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:06,632
In my dreams I found myself

651
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,134
standing on a beach
made of beetle husks

652
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:11,249
stretching as far
as the eye could see.

653
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:13,422
I woke up crying,

654
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:15,808
weeping for their
shattered little bodies.

655
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:18,177
I tried to stop Orson once.

656
00:44:18,228 --> 00:44:19,595
He was twice your size.

657
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:21,397
He just pushed me
aside with a "kuuh"

658
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:23,983
and kept on smashing.

659
00:44:24,017 --> 00:44:26,518
Every day until that mule

660
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:28,730
kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

661
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,784
So what do you think?

662
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:44,286
Why did he do it?

663
00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:46,622
What was it all about?

664
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,428
I don't know.

665
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,865
Good luck today.

666
00:45:45,398 --> 00:45:47,349
Looks like very light armor.

667
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,767
I like to move around.

668
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:51,059
You could at least
wear a helmet.

669
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:54,523
You shouldn't drink
before a fight.

670
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:56,742
You learn this during your
years in the fighting pits?

671
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:59,078
I always drink before a fight.

672
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:01,530
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

673
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:04,533
Today is not the day I die.

674
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:13,592
You're going to fight that?

675
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:16,178
I'm going to kill that.

676
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:22,217
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

677
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,970
Size does not matter when
you are flat on your back.

678
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,305
Thank the gods.

679
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:31,994
In the sight of gods and men,

680
00:46:32,028 --> 00:46:34,229
we gather to ascertain

681
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,032
the guilt or innocence
of this...

682
00:46:38,651 --> 00:46:41,203
<i>man Tyrion Lannister.</i>

683
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:43,405
<i>May the Mother grant them mercy.</i>

684
00:46:43,407 --> 00:46:47,576
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

685
00:46:47,627 --> 00:46:50,329
And may the Warrior
guide the hand...

686
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,499
- - ...of our champion--

687
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:03,642
Don't leave me
alone in this world.

688
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:05,594
Never.

689
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,699
Have they told you who I am?

690
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,418
Some dead man.

691
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:37,125
I am the brother
of Elia Martell.

692
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,212
Do you know why I have come
all the way to this stinking

693
00:47:40,263 --> 00:47:42,464
shit-pile of a city?

694
00:47:42,515 --> 00:47:44,349
For you.

695
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:51,807
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

696
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:53,859
You raped my sister.

697
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:55,310
You murdered her.

698
00:47:55,345 --> 00:47:57,112
You killed her children.

699
00:47:57,146 --> 00:47:59,865
Say it now and we can
make this quick.

700
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:10,993
Say it.
You raped her.

701
00:48:12,212 --> 00:48:14,830
You murdered her.

702
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,884
You killed her children.

703
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,730
You raped her!

704
00:48:31,764 --> 00:48:32,981
You murdered her!

705
00:48:33,016 --> 00:48:35,033
You killed her children!

706
00:49:14,223 --> 00:49:15,857
You raped her!

707
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:17,559
You murdered her!

708
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:29,905
You killed her children!

709
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:39,131
Wait.
Are you dying?

710
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:40,916
No, no, no.

711
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:44,002
You can't die yet.
You haven't confessed.

712
00:49:46,255 --> 00:49:48,757
Say it.

713
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:52,477
Say her name.
Elia Martell.

714
00:49:52,512 --> 00:49:54,763
You raped her.
You killed her children.

715
00:49:54,765 --> 00:49:57,316
Elia Martell.

716
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,067
Who gave you the order?

717
00:49:59,986 --> 00:50:01,666
Who gave you the order?!

718
00:50:01,688 --> 00:50:03,989
Say her name!

719
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:06,108
You raped her!
You murdered her!

720
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,327
<i>You killed her children.</i>

721
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:10,946
Say it.
Say her name.

722
00:50:12,532 --> 00:50:14,533
Say it!

723
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:22,874
Elia Martell.

724
00:50:24,544 --> 00:50:26,962
I killed her children.

725
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:29,464
Then I raped her.

726
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:32,634
Then I smashed her head
in like this!

727
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:48,450
The gods have made
their will known.

728
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:51,620
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

729
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:54,322
<i>in the name of King Tommen</i>
<i>of the House Baratheon,</i>

730
00:50:54,324 --> 00:50:56,329
<i>First of His Name,</i>

731
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:58,627
you are hereby
sentenced to death.
