2
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:55,624
I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

3
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,576
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

4
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,461
<i> I'm sorry,</i>
<i>what am I grateful for?</i>

5
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,246
The opportunity to live
and die at the Wall

6
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:03,248
as punishment for a crime
I did not commit?

7
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,501
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

8
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:08,253
It's not a joke. You
understand that, don't you?

9
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,973
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,677
I couldn't--

11
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,596
I couldn't listen to her

12
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,065
standing there telling her lies.

13
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,433
I couldn't do it.

14
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:24,069
You fell in love with a whore.

15
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:26,155
Yes, I fell in love
with a whore.

16
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,942
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

17
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:36,331
That deal you made,

18
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:39,118
it was everything Father wanted.

19
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,452
<i>You do see that?</i>

20
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:42,371
<i>He gets you back as his heir.</i>

21
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>The future Lord of the Rock.</i>

22
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,292
And he ships me off
to Castle Black,

23
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,128
out of sight at last.

24
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,631
All so perfect.

25
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,102
It felt good
to take that from him.

26
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:02,524
He knows I'm innocent and he's
willing to sacrifice me anyway.

27
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,476
He's willing
to sacrifice any of us.

28
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,278
Not you.

29
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,447
You're the golden son.

30
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,816
You could kill a king,
lose a hand,

31
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,068
fuck your own sister, you'll
always be the golden son.

32
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,553
Careful.

33
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:16,955
I'm the last friend you've got.

34
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,996
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

35
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:26,165
Yes, brilliant speech.

36
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,500
They'll be talking
about it for days to come.

37
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:30,969
<i>I thought you were a realist.</i>

38
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:33,639
Didn't realize
you'd die for pride.

39
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,391
Don't give up on me just yet.

40
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,977
I survived one trial by combat,

41
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:41,063
even though you weren't
there to save me.

42
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,565
I can't save you
this time either.

43
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:47,269
<i>My training has proved</i>

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,155
that I can't beat a stable
boy with my left hand.

45
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,275
Where's your sense of adventure?

46
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,528
Even if you lose,
imagine the look

47
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,830
on Father's face when you fall.

48
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:00,199
Our family name snuffed out

49
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,968
with a single swing
of the sword.

50
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,586
It is tempting.

51
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,304
Well...

52
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:25,257
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

53
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:28,727
If he wins,

54
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,779
I expect I'll be in his debt

55
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,648
for the rest of my life.

56
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,366
If he wins.

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,784
Will you find him for me?

58
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:41,740
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

59
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,543
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

60
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:48,046
I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel
that pompous child beater.

61
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,915
No.

62
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,501
Not Ser Meryn.

63
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,246
<i>Go on, move it.</i>

64
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,648
And you.

65
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,517
Come on.

66
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,696
Mercy.

67
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,331
Please.

68
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,283
Please, mercy.

69
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:37,713
Ser Gregor.
Welcome to the capital.

70
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,600
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

71
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:47,556
You seem to be in good form.

72
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,558
Who am I fighting?

73
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,777
Does it matter?

74
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:17,052
Could be food.

75
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:19,137
Could be soldiers.

76
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,198
You shouldn't be sitting
out here like this.

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,617
Where else to sit?

78
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:51,453
Tried to walk back to my hut,

79
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,972
hurt too much.

80
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:57,392
Then I remembered
they burned my hut down.

81
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,511
Who were "they"?

82
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,080
I stopped asking a while ago.

83
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,804
That's not gonna get better.

84
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:10,105
Doesn't seem so.

85
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,190
A bad way to go.

86
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,761
Haven't you had enough?

87
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,529
Of what?

88
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,567
I know.

89
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,836
Time to go.

90
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:27,706
Take matters into my own hands.

91
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,494
The thought has occurred to me.

92
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,999
So why go on?

93
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,886
Habit.

94
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,507
Nothing could
be worse than this.

95
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:49,094
Maybe nothing is
worse than this.

96
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:54,850
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

97
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,738
Nothing is just nothing.

98
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,111
Who are you?

99
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,365
My name is Arya.

100
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,667
Arya Stark.

101
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:17,956
You her father?

102
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,791
Her captor.

103
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,928
Bringing her to her aunt
for ransom.

104
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,832
A fair exchange, that is.

105
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,387
Always held to the notion
of fair exchange

106
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:35,023
in all my dealings.

107
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,477
You give me, I give you.

108
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,446
<i>Fair.</i>

109
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,949
A balance.

110
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,153
No balance anymore.

111
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,911
Could I have a drink?

112
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:58,246
Dying is thirsty work.

113
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,008
Wish it were wine.

114
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,094
So do I.

115
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:34,166
That's where the heart is.

116
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,754
That's how you kill a man.

117
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:49,047
The fuck you doing?

118
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,884
<i>There's a price on your head.</i>

119
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,720
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

120
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,122
The king's dead.

121
00:09:57,156 --> 00:10:00,275
<i>He drank poisoned wine</i>
<i>at his own wedding.</i>

122
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,311
The bounty on you is for
killing Lannister soldiers.

123
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,729
100 silver stags.

124
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,648
And you thought you
were going to collect it?

125
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:09,784
<i>Didn't think very hard, did you?</i>

126
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:13,405
You were Yoren's prisoners when
he was taking me to the Wall.

127
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:16,741
He told me he'd fuck
me bloody with a stick.

128
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:20,662
This day's really not working
out the way you planned.

129
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,831
He on your little list?

130
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:25,236
He can't be.

131
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,655
I don't know his name.

132
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:30,474
What's your name?

133
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,995
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

134
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,837
You're learning.

135
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,728
<i> Rangers returning!</i>

136
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,066
<i>They return!</i>

137
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,935
- <i> Rangers returning!</i>
- Greetings.

138
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:00,154
<i>Didn't think
I'd see you again.</i>

139
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,772
All right, Jon?

140
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,441
Welcome back, brother.

141
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,502
Lord Snow.

142
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,043
<i>This is no place</i>
<i>for wild beasts.</i>

143
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:24,045
Lock him away

144
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:26,213
or I'll let Hobb throw him
in tonight's stew.

145
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,143
Come on, Ghost.

146
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:45,399
Mance's army was closing in
on Craster's Keep when we left.

147
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,235
We saw their campfires
from Osric's Hill.

148
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,071
They'll reach the Wall
before the next full moon.

149
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm surprised you didn't
ride over and say hello.

150
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:54,658
The King-beyond-the-Wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

151
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,243
We need to prepare.

152
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:57,661
We've been preparing.

153
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,046
We should seal the tunnel.

154
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,333
Plug it with rocks and ice.

155
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:03,834
Flood it and let it freeze.

156
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:05,316
<i>And how would
we range north?</i>

157
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:07,338
- We wouldn't.
<i>-  Coward.</i>

158
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,173
You would cut off our legs,

159
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:10,841
pluck out our eyes,

160
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,760
leave us cowering
behind the Wall

161
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:14,678
hoping for the storm to pass?

162
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,264
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men.

163
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:19,767
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

164
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:23,154
The Night's Watch has defended
her for thousands of years.

165
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:26,273
And in all those centuries, we
have never sealed the tunnel.

166
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:28,576
Have you ever seen
a giant, Ser Alliser?

167
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,772
<i>I have.</i>

168
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,891
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

169
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,609
Cold-rolled steel.

170
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:38,861
They won't stop them.

171
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:43,199
Remind me which order
you belong to, Lord Snow.

172
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,201
The stewards.

173
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:48,171
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

174
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,573
No.

175
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,292
Who would that be?

176
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,079
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

177
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:58,298
First Builder Yarwyck,

178
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:01,301
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

179
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:04,003
leaving us unable
to carry out our duties

180
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:06,839
as sworn brothers
of the Night's Watch.

181
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,008
Do you agree with him?

182
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:19,269
No.

183
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,940
<i>Given your deep knowledge
of the wildling army, Lord Snow,</i>

184
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:27,327
you and Tarly will take
night duties atop the Wall

185
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:29,245
until the full moon.

186
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:33,032
<i>Moving on.</i>

187
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,953
<i>First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels
of pitch brought atop the wall.</i>

188
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,538
<i>Aye.</i>

189
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:04,364
My lord.

190
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,318
You have new clothes.

191
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,653
Do you like 'em?
Eh?

192
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:14,073
Gloves are doeskin.

193
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:15,541
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

194
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:16,993
<i>I sent for you days ago.</i>

195
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:19,829
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

196
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,501
My lonesome
bachelor days are over.

197
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,372
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

198
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,592
Lollys Stokeworth?

199
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:36,179
<i>She doesn't strike me</i>
<i>as your sort of girl.</i>

200
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,232
I wouldn't say I had
a single sort of girl.

201
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,850
She's dim-witted.

202
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,285
If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

203
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,238
When my sister arranged
this love match,

204
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,408
did she mention that Lollys
has an older sister?

205
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,859
Falyse.

206
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:52,245
Aye, I did know
about the older sister.

207
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,330
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

208
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,665
Falyse is 40 and barren.

209
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,868
<i>She still gets Castle Stokeworth
when her father dies.</i>

210
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,370
She does.

211
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,622
Unless she happens
to perish before her father.

212
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:04,540
Then Lollys gets the castle.

213
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:08,594
What? Ladies fall
from their horses

214
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,713
and snap their pretty
necks all the time.

215
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:13,216
You and my sister
deserve each other.

216
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:16,052
<i>Why did you bother to come here?</i>

217
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:25,778
You once said if anyone ever
asked me to sell you out,

218
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,397
you'd double their price.

219
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,732
Is it two wives you want
or two castles?

220
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:31,484
One of each will do.

221
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:35,071
But if you want me to kill
the Mountain for you,

222
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:36,906
it'd better be
a damn big castle.

223
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:39,292
I'm a bit short
on castles at the moment.

224
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:41,127
But I can offer you
gold and gratitude.

225
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:42,829
I have gold.

226
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,297
What can I buy with gratitude?

227
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,882
You might be surprised.

228
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,751
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

229
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,586
Your sister's a Lannister, too.

230
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:52,338
My wife is heir to Winterfell.

231
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:56,225
<i>If I emerge from this with my
head still on my shoulders,</i>

232
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,029
<i>I may one day rule</i>
<i>the North in her name.</i>

233
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:03,149
I could carve you out
a big piece of it.

234
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:05,151
If and may and could.

235
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,703
It's bloody cold up north.

236
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:10,156
Lollys is soft and warm.

237
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,941
And close.

238
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:14,660
If I gave you the choice
between fucking Lollys

239
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,662
and fighting the Mountain,
you'd have your britches down

240
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:18,030
and your cock out
before I could blink.

241
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,866
Does he frighten you so much?

242
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,118
I'd be a bloody fool
if he didn't frighten me.

243
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:24,036
He's freakish big
and freakish strong.

244
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,873
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

245
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,510
Maybe I could take him,

246
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:32,795
dance around until he's so tired

247
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,564
of hacking at me,
he dropped his sword,

248
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,632
get him off his feet somehow.

249
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,601
But one misstep...

250
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,303
...and I'm dead.

251
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,605
Why should I risk it?

252
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,141
Because you're my friend.

253
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:47,310
Aye, I'm your friend.

254
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,730
And when have you ever
risked your life for me?

255
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,908
I like you,

256
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,377
pampered little shit
that you are.

257
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:06,746
I just like myself more.

258
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,381
I understand.

259
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,082
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

260
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,751
Why are you sorry?

261
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:13,836
Because you're an evil bastard

262
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,805
with no conscience and no heart?

263
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,508
<i>That's what I liked about</i>
<i>you in the first place.</i>

264
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:27,016
We had some good days together.

265
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,851
Yes, we did.

266
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,084
What will you do?

267
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:48,588
I suppose I'll have to kill
the Mountain myself.

268
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,542
Won't that make
for a great song?

269
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,381
I hope to hear
them sing it one day.

270
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,150
How did you get in here?

271
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,819
Your door is well guarded,

272
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,988
but your window is not.

273
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:31,330
I swam to an island
a mile offshore for these.

274
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,883
Don't do that again.

275
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,837
Never met a woman who
didn't like wildflowers.

276
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:40,306
These are my private quarters.

277
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,892
If I want you here,
I will summon you.

278
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:47,313
Forgive me, my queen.
I live to serve you.

279
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:55,605
<i>Tell me why you're here.</i>

280
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,510
I came to ask a favor.

281
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,863
I only have two talents
in this world--

282
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,248
war and women.

283
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,951
<i>You are staying here</i>
<i>in Meereen to rule.</i>

284
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:11,170
<i>That is a wise decision.</i>
<i>I respect it.</i>

285
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:13,089
But here in Meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

286
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:15,758
I've ordered the Second Sons
to patrol the streets

287
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,510
to stop the revenge killing.

288
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:18,794
You've ordered us
to be night watchmen.

289
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:20,796
And as for women,

290
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,550
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

291
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:27,353
There is only one,

292
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,022
and she does not want me.

293
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:32,858
You swore me your sword.

294
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:35,478
My sword is yours
till the day I die.

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,647
So if I command you
to stay in Meereen

296
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,148
and patrol the streets?

297
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,867
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

298
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:44,387
Send me to kill your enemies.

299
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:46,706
Any enemy anywhere.

300
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,292
Let me do what I do best.

301
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,496
Very well.

302
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,554
Do what you do best.

303
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,600
Take off your clothes.

304
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,347
Oh.

305
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,601
Come in, my queen.
Please.

306
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,553
I didn't mean
to disturb you, my lady.

307
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:52,104
You could never disturb me.

308
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:54,523
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

309
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,393
Could you bring me
that vial over there?

310
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,864
The blue one.

311
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,402
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Not that one.</i>

312
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,621
You don't even want
to touch that one.

313
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,823
<i>Next to it.</i>

314
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,875
<i>That's the one.</i>

315
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,562
When I looked into
the flames this morning,

316
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:35,815
the Lord spoke to me.

317
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,733
He said,

318
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:42,238
"Tonight, you will have your
last good bath in a long while.

319
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,490
Make it count."

320
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,111
A joke.

321
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:52,915
Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

322
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,784
It was. I--

323
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:57,453
humor isn't my strength.

324
00:21:57,455 --> 00:21:59,121
That's because
most jokes are lies

325
00:21:59,123 --> 00:22:01,841
and you're devoted to the truth.

326
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,127
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

327
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,630
Not always.

328
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,191
Most of these powders
and potions

329
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:20,810
are lies.

330
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:25,397
<i>Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our Lord's power.</i>

331
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:28,894
Once they step into his light, they
will see the lie for what it was--

332
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:32,231
a trick that lead them to the truth.

333
00:22:32,282 --> 00:22:35,034
<i>A pinch of this powder</i>
<i>in a bonfire</i>

334
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,320
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

335
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:41,123
And this one creates
a black smoke

336
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:43,575
that will make the bravest
man piss himself with fear.

337
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:47,046
And a drop of this
in any man's wine

338
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,381
will drive him wild with lust.

339
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,837
Did you use it with Stannis?

340
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,221
No.

341
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:00,509
Don't be upset.

342
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,762
Men never crave
what they already have.

343
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:07,516
It's only flesh.

344
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,185
It needs what it needs.

345
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,408
No act done in service
of the Lord

346
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:19,244
can ever be called a sin.

347
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,698
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

348
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,334
And Stannis to you.

349
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:29,872
He wants to bring
Shireen with us.

350
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:34,343
I think that would be
ill-advised.

351
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:38,013
<i>My daughter has heretical
tendencies, as you're well aware.</i>

352
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:41,850
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

353
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:45,270
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

354
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,577
I understand how you feel.

355
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:52,978
Hmm.

356
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:55,230
But that is impossible.

357
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,068
Why?

358
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,906
You don't need powders
and potions, my queen.

359
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:06,074
You don't need lies.

360
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:09,578
You are strong enough to
look into the Lord's light

361
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,964
and see his truth for yourself.

362
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,922
However harsh it is.

363
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,424
However hard for us
to understand.

364
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:25,511
<i>You don't need my help,</i>

365
00:24:25,562 --> 00:24:28,347
<i>but I will need yours soon.</i>

366
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:31,433
When we set sail, your
daughter must be with us.

367
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:37,105
The Lord needs her.

368
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,832
Jorah the Andal.

369
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:50,169
Are you here to see our queen?

370
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,006
She's in a good mood.

371
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,973
Khaleesi.

372
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,392
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

373
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:17,145
You don't approve?

374
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:19,615
It's not a question of approval,
it's a question of trust.

375
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,984
You neither approve nor trust.

376
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:23,619
Why would I?
The man's a sellsword.

377
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:25,173
Didn't you fight for
the Golden Company

378
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:26,738
before pledging
your sword to my brother?

379
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,457
I did.

380
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:29,908
I trust you.

381
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,411
Daario Naharis
killed his captains

382
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:35,631
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

383
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:38,166
How could you ever have
faith in a man like that?

384
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:41,553
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

385
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,724
That's why I've sent him and the
Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

386
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,978
- You have?
- I have.

387
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,064
Without you there
to rule, Khaleesi,

388
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,349
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

389
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,652
wait for the invaders
to leave and reassert control.

390
00:25:56,686 --> 00:26:00,822
That is why I've ordered Daario to
execute every master in Yunkai.

391
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:04,826
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

392
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:07,329
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

393
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,748
They train little girls in the
art of pleasuring old men.

394
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:12,918
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

395
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:16,505
Herding the masters into pens and
slaughtering them by the thousands

396
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,540
is also treating men
like beasts.

397
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,709
The slaves you freed,

398
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,878
brutality is all
they've ever known.

399
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:25,013
If you want them to know
something else,

400
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,381
you'll have to show it to them.

401
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,517
And repay the slavers
with what? Kindness?

402
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:30,052
A fine?
A stern warning?

403
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:33,221
It's tempting to see your
enemies as evil, all of them,

404
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,974
but there's good and evil on both
sides in every war ever fought.

405
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:38,477
Let the priests argue
over good and evil.

406
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:40,062
Slavery is real.

407
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:42,314
I can end it.
I will end it.

408
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:44,650
<i>And I will end those behind it.</i>

409
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,885
I sold men
into slavery, Khaleesi.

410
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,740
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

411
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:55,160
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

412
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:58,046
what you want to do
to the masters of Yunkai.

413
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:05,470
The man who came to me the other
day about burying his father.

414
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:07,589
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

415
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:10,309
He will accompany
the Second Sons

416
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:12,260
and serve as my
ambassador to Yunkai.

417
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:15,263
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

418
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,900
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

419
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,852
They can live in my new world

420
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:23,939
or they can die
in their old one.

421
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,529
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

422
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,447
Tell him I changed my mind.

423
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,833
Yes, Khaleesi.

424
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:41,790
No.

425
00:27:44,677 --> 00:27:47,379
Tell him<i> you</i> changed my mind.

426
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:01,043
Rat cunts.

427
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:04,780
Fucking whore.

428
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,316
<i>You're doing it wrong.</i>

429
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,286
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

430
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,039
<i>Otherwise it's gonna</i>
<i>get infected and fester.</i>

431
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:19,494
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right--

432
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,463
No fire.

433
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:24,750
It'll only take a second.

434
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:27,169
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

435
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:43,852
Shut up about it.

436
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:48,607
Shut up about everything.

437
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:51,326
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

438
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,612
anywhere the Lannisters
hold sway.

439
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:57,165
Which is everywhere
between where we are now

440
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,201
and where we're going.

441
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:04,873
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

442
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:09,044
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

443
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:13,965
No reward is worth
this much trouble.

444
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:16,935
<i>Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.</i>

445
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:30,198
You say your brother
gave you that sword.

446
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,619
My brother gave me this.

447
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:38,874
It was just like you said
a while back.

448
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:40,709
<i>Pressed me to the fire</i>

449
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:43,628
like I was a nice
juicy mutton chop.

450
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,416
Why?

451
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:50,302
Thought I stole one of his toys.

452
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:52,921
I didn't steal it. I was
just playing with it.

453
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,761
The pain was bad.

454
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:01,847
The smell was worse.

455
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:09,187
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

456
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:16,278
My father, who protected him...

457
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:20,949
told everyone my bedding
caught fire.

458
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:36,047
You think you're on your own?

459
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,605
Let me wash it out

460
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,908
and help you sew it up at least.

461
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:11,803
Bit of comfort
never hurt anyone.

462
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:14,022
We've been sleeping in
ditches the last few weeks.

463
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:16,891
I think we can treat ourselves
to a featherbed for the night

464
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:19,811
and a hot meal
not cooked by you.

465
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,313
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

466
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,231
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

467
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,483
Not working for your
former lord any longer.

468
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,819
- Yes, my lady.
- Don't get drunk.

469
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:30,655
No, my lady.

470
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,157
<i>Can I get
you anything else?</i>

471
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,959
No, this will do
nicely, thank you.

472
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,493
Kidney pie is wonderful.

473
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,495
Thanks.

474
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,714
I do my best.

475
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,918
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

476
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,921
<i>Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.</i>

477
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,757
Easy enough.
But the meat,

478
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:51,760
peacetime or not, getting your
hands on a good bottom round steak

479
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:53,478
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

480
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,064
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

481
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:58,350
Got no right to cook
anything, them.

482
00:31:58,401 --> 00:31:59,985
Oh, and the gravy.

483
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,853
Don't get me started
on the gravy.

484
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:03,238
<i>Very difficult to get right.</i>

485
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:05,073
<i>See, a lot of people</i>
<i>give up on the gravy.</i>

486
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:07,325
You cannot give up on the gravy.

487
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,910
No gravy, no pie.

488
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:11,363
Simple as that.

489
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:14,699
That's nice armor.
Are you a knight?

490
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,286
No.

491
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,456
Oh, it's just people with
armor are usually knights.

492
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,175
<i>Generally speaking. From King's
Landing, though, aren't you?</i>

493
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,045
<i>From there myself originally.</i>
<i>Flea Bottom born and bred.</i>

494
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,880
<i>What brings you to these parts?</i>

495
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:30,882
We're looking for someone.

496
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,385
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

497
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,747
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17--

498
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:37,722
A girl, tall, red hair,
very pretty.

499
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:41,226
Her name is Sansa Stark, but she
may be using a different name.

500
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:43,228
Starks?

501
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:49,234
What, like them lot
from "Winterhell"?

502
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:54,789
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

503
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,574
I heard they was all traitors.

504
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,910
Don't need no traitors in here.

505
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:02,247
<i>I pledged my life to</i>
<i>their mother Catelyn Stark.</i>

506
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:04,516
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

507
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,473
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

508
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,771
What?

509
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,406
It's nothing, my lady.

510
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:31,776
You wouldn't be screwing your face
up like that if it was nothing.

511
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:34,279
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

512
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,114
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

513
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,201
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

514
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,921
The Lannisters have money.

515
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:44,756
People kill for money.

516
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,842
I don't think we should
be telling people

517
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,461
we're searching for Lady Sansa.

518
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:02,140
My lady. My lord.
Could I have a word?

519
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,142
What about?
Not kidney pie.

520
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:05,727
<i>You seem like a proper lady.</i>

521
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,196
<i>Someone who could be trusted.</i>

522
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,317
I never met no Sansa Stark.

523
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:14,452
But I know her sister...

524
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,321
Arya.

525
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:22,076
No one's seen Arya Stark since
her father was beheaded.

526
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:24,929
She's presumed dead.

527
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:26,881
She weren't when I last
spoke to her.

528
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:29,300
- When was that? -<i> Heading up north with</i>
<i>the Night's Watch.</i>

529
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,835
She was all dressed up as a boy.

530
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:33,671
Like your ladyship,
only without the armor.

531
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,557
<i>Going by the name Arry.</i>

532
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:37,375
- So what happened to her?
- Well--

533
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,561
The quick version.

534
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,429
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

535
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,314
We escaped.

536
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,517
The Brotherhood took
us prisoner.

537
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:47,018
They sold me to the innkeep.

538
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:49,654
<i>They were gonna sell Arya</i>
<i>to her mother at Riverrun</i>

539
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:50,989
<i>along with another prisoner.</i>

540
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,907
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth

541
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,943
and a face like
a half-burnt ham.

542
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,911
- <i> Not friendly.</i>
- The Hound.

543
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,696
That's the one.

544
00:34:58,747 --> 00:35:02,033
If you find her,
could you give her this?

545
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,868
She liked the last one
I gave her,

546
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:06,254
but, well, this one
turned out better.

547
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,550
Um, you were saying?

548
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:25,306
<i>Her mother's
dead, grandfather's dead,</i>

549
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,725
Walder Frey is
the new lord of Riverrun.

550
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,611
The Brotherhood
isn't going to Riverrun.

551
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,563
They'll take her
to the Eyrie, my lady.

552
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:33,398
Why the Eyrie?

553
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,900
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

554
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:38,036
Catelyn Stark's sister.

555
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,072
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

556
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:43,875
She hates the Lannisters.

557
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:48,162
Lord Tyrion made sure I knew

558
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:51,299
which house married which
and who hated who.

559
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,051
Sansa could be there, too.

560
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:55,553
Aye, my lady.

561
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:57,255
Could be.

562
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,597
You sure about this?

563
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:10,485
No.

564
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,435
I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

565
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,190
I did spend some time with an absolutely
stunning blonde the other day.

566
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:52,043
Mm, do tell.

567
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:55,480
I've got every kind
of filth down here

568
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:57,031
except the kind I like.

569
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,067
Your sister.

570
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:01,319
Oh.

571
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,911
Cersei approached me.

572
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:13,264
<i>We spoke a great deal</i>
<i>about her daughter.</i>

573
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:16,384
How worried your sister
is about her.

574
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:19,337
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>very hard to pretend</i>

575
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,372
<i>she had not come</i>
<i>to sway me against you.</i>

576
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,675
<i>I think she may have even</i>
<i>believed it herself.</i>

577
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:26,761
Making honest feelings
do dishonest work

578
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,230
is one of her many gifts.

579
00:37:29,264 --> 00:37:32,266
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

580
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:37,071
It is rare to meet a Lannister

581
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:41,109
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

582
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:45,697
She desperately wants
to see you killed.

583
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,915
She didn't need to bother you.

584
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:51,753
It looks as though I've
taken care of that myself.

585
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:54,372
<i>The joy she will feel</i>

586
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,958
<i>when my head leaves my neck.</i>

587
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:00,244
She's wanted this
for a long time.

588
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,047
Yes, I know.

589
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:06,100
<i>We met, you and I.</i>

590
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:07,719
Many years ago.

591
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,722
I think I would
have remembered that.

592
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:14,058
Unlikely.
You had just been born.

593
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:19,030
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

594
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,732
on a visit to Casterly Rock.

595
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:22,734
<i>My first time away from Dorne.</i>

596
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:25,153
I didn't like anything
about the Rock.

597
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,123
Not the food, not the weather,

598
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:30,825
not your accents.

599
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,493
Nothing.

600
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,414
But the biggest
disappointment...

601
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:38,750
you.

602
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:43,588
You and my family have more in
common than you might admit.

603
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,807
<i>The whole way from Dorne</i>

604
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:48,676
all anyone talked about
was the monster

605
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,679
that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

606
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,599
<i>A head twice</i>
<i>the size of his body,</i>

607
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,517
<i>a tail between his legs,</i>

608
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,653
claws, one red eye,

609
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:01,606
the privates of both
a girl and a boy.

610
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,574
That would have made
things so much easier.

611
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:07,445
<i>When we met your sister, she
promised she would show you to us.</i>

612
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:09,113
Every day we would ask.

613
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,616
Every day she would
say, "Soon."

614
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:14,952
Then she and your brother

615
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:18,339
took us to your nursery and...

616
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,710
she unveiled the freak.

617
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,764
<i>Your head was a bit large.</i>

618
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,699
<i>Your arms and legs</i>
<i>were a bit small,</i>

619
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,384
but no claw.

620
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,721
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.

621
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,140
Just a tiny pink cock.

622
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:38,943
<i>We didn't try to hide</i>
<i>our disappointment.</i>

623
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,395
<i>"That's not a monster,"</i>
<i>I told Cersei.</i>

624
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:44,449
"That's just a baby."

625
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,569
<i>And she said,</i>
<i>"He killed my mother."</i>

626
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,122
<i>And she pinched</i>
<i>your little cock so hard,</i>

627
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,157
<i>I thought she might pull it off.</i>

628
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,293
<i>Until your brother</i>
<i>made her stop.</i>

629
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,395
<i>"It doesn't matter,"</i>
<i>she told us.</i>

630
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,381
<i>"Everyone says he will die soon.</i>

631
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:02,049
<i>I hope they are right.</i>

632
00:40:02,084 --> 00:40:04,752
<i>He should not</i>
<i>have lived this long."</i>

633
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:09,974
Well...

634
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:17,231
sooner or later, Cersei
always gets what she wants.

635
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:22,286
And what about what I want?

636
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,858
Justice

637
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,495
for my sister and her children.

638
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:32,530
If you want justice,

639
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:35,449
you've come to the wrong place.

640
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,702
I disagree.

641
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,262
I've come to the perfect place.

642
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,350
I want to bring those who
have wronged me to justice.

643
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:55,469
And all those who have
wronged me are right here.

644
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:00,024
I will begin with
Ser Gregor Clegane,

645
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,810
<i>who killed my sister's children</i>

646
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,230
and then raped her with their
blood still on his hands

647
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,983
before killing her, too.

648
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,744
I will be your champion.

649
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:15,800
Hello, Robin.

650
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:19,720
What are you doing?

651
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,689
I'm building my home,
Winterfell.

652
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:23,774
At least I think I am.

653
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,477
I haven't been back there
in a very long time.

654
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:28,863
Why did you leave?

655
00:42:28,897 --> 00:42:31,282
It's a long story.

656
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,485
I stay here in the Eyrie.

657
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:37,305
Mother says it's dangerous on the
roads and I have to keep myself safe

658
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,973
because I'm the Lord of the Vale

659
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:41,325
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

660
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,661
Yes, you certainly are.

661
00:42:43,663 --> 00:42:45,930
When will you go back?

662
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,666
Probably never.

663
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:50,801
My family doesn't
live there anymore

664
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:53,304
and someone burned it down.

665
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:56,173
Oh.

666
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:58,976
Does Winterfell
have a Moon Door?

667
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:00,778
No, I'm afraid not.

668
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,930
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

669
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,815
That sounds dangerous.

670
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,652
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

671
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,070
What do you do with
all the bad people

672
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:11,572
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

673
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:13,157
I never did anything
with them at all.

674
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,826
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

675
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:19,163
Well, I'm Lord of the Vale.

676
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:22,500
When I grow up, I'll be able
to fly anybody who bothers me.

677
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,869
Or you.
When we get married,

678
00:43:24,871 --> 00:43:26,671
you can tell me
if you don't like somebody

679
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,956
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

680
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,841
Right through the Moon Door.

681
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:34,462
I like the sound of that.

682
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:36,213
Let's put a Moon Door
in your Winterfell.

683
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:37,715
All right.

684
00:43:37,717 --> 00:43:39,717
It can go in here
in this big tower.

685
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,802
Careful.
You've ruined it.

686
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,270
Now I'm going to have
to rebuild the whole thing.

687
00:43:43,305 --> 00:43:44,855
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

688
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,841
It was already ruined because
it didn't have a Moon Door.

689
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,225
I was fixing it.

690
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:49,560
Knocking things down
isn't fixing them.

691
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:51,395
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

692
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:53,898
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

693
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:06,994
Robin, I'm sorry, I--

694
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,630
<i>Children.</i>

695
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:15,586
- <i> I hit him.</i>
- Yes, I saw.

696
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:16,971
I shouldn't have done that.

697
00:44:17,005 --> 00:44:20,091
No, his mother should have

698
00:44:20,142 --> 00:44:22,443
a long time ago.

699
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:25,846
Consider it a step
in the right direction.

700
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:29,016
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

701
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,435
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

702
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:35,573
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

703
00:44:36,825 --> 00:44:38,876
I'll never see it again.

704
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:43,664
A lot can happen
between now and never.

705
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:47,952
If you want to build
a better home,

706
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:50,838
first you must
demolish the old one.

707
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,876
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

708
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,099
Tell me why.

709
00:45:06,354 --> 00:45:09,940
I loved your mother more
than you could ever know.

710
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:15,279
Given the opportunity,
what do we do to those

711
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,348
who've hurt the ones we love?

712
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,074
In a better world,

713
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,493
one where love

714
00:45:29,495 --> 00:45:33,464
could overcome
strength and duty,

715
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:37,218
you might have been my child.

716
00:45:40,222 --> 00:45:42,756
But we don't live in that world.

717
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:56,770
You're more beautiful
than she ever was.

718
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:00,191
Lord Baelish...

719
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:02,193
Call me Petyr.

720
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:31,589
<i>You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?</i>

721
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,192
Come here, Sansa.

722
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,709
Do you know how far the fall is?

723
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:54,712
No.

724
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,947
<i>Neither do I, precisely.</i>

725
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,516
<i>Hundreds of feet.</i>

726
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,669
It's fascinating

727
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,589
what happens to bodies when they
hit the rocks from such a height.

728
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:07,641
The impact breaks them
right apart.

729
00:47:07,676 --> 00:47:11,095
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

730
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:13,564
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

731
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:16,267
You'll find the head
sitting on its own.

732
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:18,402
Every hair in place.

733
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,322
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

734
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:32,866
I know what you did.

735
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,870
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

736
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,757
I never should have hit Robin, I know it.
I promise it won't happen--

737
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,508
Don't be coy with me,
you little whore.

738
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:43,961
You kissed him.
You kissed Petyr.

739
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:46,213
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

740
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:49,550
You can't lie to me because
I saw it with my own eyes.

741
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,435
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar!

742
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,355
Whore! He is mine!

743
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:56,890
My father, my husband,
my sister,

744
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:59,109
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

745
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:03,197
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

746
00:48:03,231 --> 00:48:04,898
Look down!

747
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,318
Look down!
Look down! Look down!

748
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:10,237
<i>Lysa!</i>

749
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:12,906
Let her go.

750
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:17,962
You want her?

751
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:21,632
This empty-headed child?

752
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,167
Let her go.

753
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:26,003
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

754
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:28,572
I lied for you.

755
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,607
<i>I killed for you.</i>

756
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,977
Why did you bring
her here? Why?

757
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,928
I'll send her away.

758
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:38,816
I swear on my life.

759
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:42,319
I swear to all the gods.

760
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,189
Let her go, Lysa.

761
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,626
Oh, my sweet wife.

762
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:11,382
My sweet, silly wife.

763
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:21,191
I have only loved one woman...

764
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,944
only one,

765
00:49:23,978 --> 00:49:26,397
my entire life.

766
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:33,153
Your sister.

767
00:49:42,992 --> 00:49:53,687
