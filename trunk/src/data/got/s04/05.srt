2
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,271
<i>May the
Warrior grant him courage</i>

3
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:00,591
and protect him
in these perilous times.

4
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,093
May the Smith grant him strength

5
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:04,978
that he might bear
this heavy burden

6
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,231
And may the Crone,

7
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:09,600
she that knows
the fate of all men,

8
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,236
show him the path he must walk

9
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,689
and guide him through the
dark places that lie ahead.

10
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,026
In the light of the Seven,
I now proclaim Tommen

11
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,912
of the House Baratheon
First of His Name

12
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:24,698
King of the Andals
and the First Men

13
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,584
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:32,589
Long may he reign!

15
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,625
Long may he reign!

16
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,386
Special day.

17
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:07,074
Your Grace.

18
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,911
Your Grace.

19
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:37,020
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

20
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,655
Your Grace.

21
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,676
There he is.

22
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,879
Long may he reign.

23
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,714
Long may he reign.

24
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,020
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

25
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,724
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

26
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,276
No, he wasn't.

27
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,201
You still mourn for Joffrey?

28
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,403
He was my husband.
My king.

29
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,572
He would have been
your nightmare.

30
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:34,828
Your Grace, I feel...

31
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:37,014
You knew exactly what he was.

32
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:39,633
I did, too.

33
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,118
You never love
anything in the world

34
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:43,554
the way you love
your first child.

35
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,758
Doesn't matter what they do.

36
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:53,180
And what he did, it shocked me.

37
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,768
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

38
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,202
No.

39
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:02,639
The things he did shocked me.

40
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,948
He's only a boy.

41
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,450
A good boy.
A decent boy.

42
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,369
He always has been.

43
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,589
<i>Who was the last</i>
<i>decent king, I wonder?</i>

44
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:20,507
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

45
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,293
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

46
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:27,431
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

47
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:30,500
For all the horror
that put him there.

48
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,741
He will need help...

49
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:41,111
if he's going to rule well.

50
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:43,113
He has you.

51
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:45,732
A mother is not enough.

52
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:50,320
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

53
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:52,155
Oh.

54
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:54,241
After all
that's happened...

55
00:05:56,878 --> 00:06:00,330
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am...

56
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,799
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

57
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,584
what comes next.

58
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:07,838
It would be a great
honor, of course.

59
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,974
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

60
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:15,345
Yes, speak to your father.

61
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:18,265
I'll speak to mine.

62
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,406
We may be faced with an alarming
number of weddings soon.

63
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,193
I won't even know
what to call you.

64
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,030
Sister?

65
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,950
Or Mother?

66
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:39,503
Hmm.

67
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:43,073
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

68
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,526
Murdered at his own wedding.

69
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,930
<i> And we have taken the
Meereenese navy, Your Grace.</i>

70
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:52,182
The Second Sons took
the Meereenese navy.

71
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:54,217
Who told you to take the navy?

72
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:56,386
No one.

73
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,889
So why did you do it?

74
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:00,941
I heard you liked ships.

75
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,563
How many ships?

76
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,864
93, Your Grace.

77
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,232
How many men can they carry?

78
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:12,152
9,300, not counting sailors.

79
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:14,121
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

80
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,989
The Lannisters have more.

81
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,408
<i>They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.</i>

82
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,243
They're tired, dispersed.

83
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:22,579
<i>And now their king is dead.</i>

84
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:26,216
8,000 Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons

85
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,752
<i>sailing into Blackwater Bay</i>

86
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:31,555
<i>and storming the gates</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

87
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,177
It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

88
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,764
But we're not fighting to make
you queen of King's Landing.

89
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:43,767
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

90
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,469
The old houses
will flock to our queen

91
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,070
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

92
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,906
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

93
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:52,025
as they always have.

94
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:56,329
There's other news.

95
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:58,115
From Yunkai.

96
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,535
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

97
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:04,454
<i>the Wise Masters have</i>
<i>retaken control of the city.</i>

98
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:07,507
<i>They've reenslaved the
freedmen who stayed behind</i>

99
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,676
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

100
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,096
And in Astapor,

101
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,849
the council you installed
to rule over the city

102
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:18,969
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

103
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,355
<i>who's declared himself</i>
<i>"His Imperial Majesty."</i>

104
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,309
Please leave me.

105
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,617
Not you, Jorah.

106
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,582
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

107
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,634
isn't going quite as planned.

108
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,554
You could sail for Westeros

109
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,590
and leave it all behind.

110
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,308
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

111
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:01,511
A boy many believe to be a
bastard with no right to it.

112
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:04,397
They've never been
more vulnerable.

113
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,851
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

114
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:10,487
I didn't listen.

115
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:12,656
That all worked out well.

116
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:22,282
How can I rule seven kingdoms

117
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,035
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

118
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:29,089
Why should anyone trust me?

119
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,708
Why should anyone follow me?

120
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,226
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

121
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:35,295
You're the Mother of Dragons.

122
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,716
I need to be more than that.

123
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:50,894
I will not let those I have
freed slide back into chains.

124
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:53,897
I will not sail for Westeros.

125
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,932
What, then?

126
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,836
I will do what queens do.

127
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:05,075
I will rule.

128
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,445
Pull up your hood.

129
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,783
A memorable shade.

130
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,669
But how would they know?

131
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:53,173
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

132
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,126
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

133
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,016
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

134
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,218
The mountains are impassable.

135
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,803
If you want to get to the Eyrie,

136
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:08,722
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

137
00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:12,225
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

138
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:14,945
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

139
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:16,980
three men abreast

140
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:19,566
and get slaughtered like goats.

141
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:22,569
The first Lords of the
Vale didn't have much,

142
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,154
but they had these mountains

143
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,156
and they knew how to use them.

144
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,908
And the fortress they built
here has never been overcome.

145
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,711
Not once in 1,000 years.

146
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:34,497
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

147
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:37,917
and one man can be worth 10,000.

148
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:44,874
Who would
pass the Bloody Gate?

149
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:48,178
Lord Petyr Baelish
and his niece Alayne.

150
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:53,900
Stand to.

151
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:56,569
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

152
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,356
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

153
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:31,855
Uncle Petyr!

154
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,359
<i>My lord.</i>

155
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,067
Oh.

156
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,321
I have brought you a gift.

157
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:54,494
Lord Baelish.

158
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:57,247
- My lady.
- Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

159
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:59,916
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

160
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:02,635
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

161
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,170
My name is Al...

162
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:06,673
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

163
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,758
Don't you think know
who you are?

164
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,644
<i>You think I'd let my intended</i>

165
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,646
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

166
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:16,316
without knowing
what that business was?

167
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:21,654
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

168
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:27,694
My flesh and blood.

169
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,614
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

170
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,950
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

171
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:35,118
Of course.
I understand.

172
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,753
No one can know you're here.

173
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,872
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

174
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:40,507
I would never say a thing.

175
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,093
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

176
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,044
They've been trying for years.

177
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:47,130
<i>Now they know</i>
<i>what it feels like.</i>

178
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:50,967
Mummy said they killed your mother and
they chopped off your brother's head.

179
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,189
They did, and my father's.

180
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,808
They killed my father,
too, with poison.

181
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:02,946
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

182
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,148
but Mother said I couldn't.

183
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,983
Make him fly?

184
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,068
Through the Moon Door.

185
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:15,892
<i>And on top of
everything else,</i>

186
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,461
they made you marry
that filthy troll.

187
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,663
They did.
They made us both.

188
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:22,081
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

189
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,033
<i>I don't believe
that for a moment.</i>

190
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:26,085
Did he force himself on you?

191
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,837
No.

192
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,389
- We never...
<i> Good.</i>

193
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:32,809
Robin, this is
your cousin Sansa.

194
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:35,011
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

195
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:36,863
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

196
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,315
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

197
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:42,485
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

198
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,854
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

199
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:47,073
Take the back stairs.

200
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,028
Go.
We'll speak soon.

201
00:15:00,955 --> 00:15:02,872
What took you so long?

202
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:05,875
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

203
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:09,546
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

204
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:13,383
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

205
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,604
Let's get married tonight.

206
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:19,939
Ought we not...

207
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:23,059
inform the Lords of the
Vale about the ceremony?

208
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,978
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

209
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,863
The others can all hang.

210
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,315
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

211
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:32,785
the moment my husband died,
trying to get their claws in me.

212
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,320
I do think that
we could wait until...

213
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,706
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

214
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,075
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

215
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:41,211
Or don't you remember?

216
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:44,214
Like it was yesterday.

217
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:48,418
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

218
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,304
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

219
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:54,173
When you gave me those drops

220
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:56,643
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

221
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:58,144
my husband's wine...

222
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:01,347
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

223
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:03,733
telling her it was
the Lannisters...

224
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,947
The deed is done.

225
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:20,617
Faded into nothing.

226
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:23,620
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

227
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,675
Tonight it is, then.

228
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,131
Let me bathe and dress
for the occasion.

229
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,601
Once I'm presentable, I'll call
on the septon immediately.

230
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:47,527
I'm warning you.

231
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,648
I'm going to scream when my
husband makes love to me.

232
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,867
I'm going to scream so loud,

233
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:57,987
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

234
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:26,282
When will the wedding
take place in your mind?

235
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,017
As soon as decency permits.

236
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:32,055
After we've allowed Tommen the
appropriate time to mourn his brother

237
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:34,824
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

238
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:37,327
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

239
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,363
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

240
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,700
no 77-course meals.

241
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,137
And your wedding to Loras?

242
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,757
Shortly after Tommen's.

243
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,176
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

244
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,462
I know you don't like them.

245
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:58,915
I didn't like your husband.

246
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:01,150
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

247
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:02,785
I didn't trust him.

248
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,821
We had that in common.

249
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:08,458
You don't need to make formal
alliances with people you trust.

250
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:11,110
Then whom can we trust?

251
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:14,897
Ourselves alone.

252
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:19,402
The Tyrells

253
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:22,071
are our only true rivals

254
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,823
in terms of resources

255
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:27,076
and we need them on our side.

256
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,545
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

257
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,799
Robert had me funding him.

258
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,085
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

259
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:39,472
I suppose that explains why we
did so well in the last one.

260
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:43,559
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

261
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:44,727
Haven't a clue.

262
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:46,429
Go on, your best guess.

263
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,265
Pounds, tons, ounces?

264
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,768
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

265
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,437
That can't be.

266
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,523
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

267
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:00,660
Then how do we pay for anything?

268
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:03,112
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

269
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:04,781
a tremendous amount of money.

270
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,416
How much?

271
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,585
A tremendous amount.

272
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:13,790
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

273
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,259
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

274
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,044
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

275
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,679
There is no someone.

276
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:22,298
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

277
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,434
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

278
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:27,386
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

279
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:32,058
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

280
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:35,695
That's what the Iron Bank is...
a temple.

281
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:38,948
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

282
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,485
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

283
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,254
You can't sway them
with excuses.

284
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,925
If you owe them money and you
don't want to crumble yourself,

285
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,410
you pay it back.

286
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:53,246
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown

287
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:55,081
will help a great deal
in this respect.

288
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:58,935
It's for the good of the
family, I understand that.

289
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,590
I'm not sure my brothers do.

290
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,931
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

291
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:15,151
<i>And as a mother,</i>
<i>that is your right.</i>

292
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:19,689
But as a judge, I cannot
discuss the trial with you.

293
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,858
I respect that.

294
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,529
We don't need to discuss it.

295
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,502
The Lannister legacy is the
only thing that matters.

296
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:35,705
You've started wars
to protect this family.

297
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,040
Turned your back on Jaime

298
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:41,143
for refusing to
contribute to its future.

299
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:44,413
What does Tyrion deserve

300
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,999
for lighting
that future on fire?

301
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,945
<i>Joffrey.</i>

302
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:01,147
Cersei.

303
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:03,149
Walder Frey.

304
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,434
Meryn Trant.

305
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:08,271
<i>Tywin Lannister.</i>

306
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:10,406
The Red Woman.

307
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,792
Beric Dondarrion.

308
00:21:12,826 --> 00:21:15,912
<i>Thoros of Myr.</i>

309
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:17,880
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

310
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,749
The Mountain.

311
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,717
Would you shut up?

312
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:25,137
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

313
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:28,808
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

314
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,677
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

315
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:36,098
Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

316
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,684
Better than most.

317
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:42,238
We come across my brother,

318
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,741
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

319
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:51,530
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

320
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,457
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up

321
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,626
so I can get some sleep.

322
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:09,599
Go on, get it over with,

323
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:12,218
your list of doomed men.

324
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:16,355
I'm almost done.

325
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,524
Only one name left.

326
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,277
Go on.

327
00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:31,153
The Hound.

328
00:22:38,211 --> 00:22:39,462
Thank you.

329
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,547
Your mother always had a
sweet tooth, you know?

330
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:43,132
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

331
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,335
At suppertime, she would go
straight for honey cakes,

332
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,054
candied almonds, custard.

333
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:49,755
Anything sweet.

334
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:51,340
Eventually, your grandfather

335
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:53,926
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

336
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:56,512
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

337
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:58,514
It was important
that she remain desirable

338
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,182
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

339
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,902
and she was starting to get fat.

340
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:06,355
My mother fat?

341
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,576
She never let me have my pudding

342
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,361
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

343
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:15,781
This is before she married your
father and moved to the North.

344
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:19,418
By the time you were born, your
father's austerity had become hers.

345
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:22,505
Marriage changes people.

346
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,209
I didn't mean for you to stop.

347
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,045
Go on, enjoy them.

348
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,217
How do you like them?

349
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:37,269
They're delicious.

350
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,641
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

351
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:44,310
Oh, gods, no.

352
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:47,480
Petyr had three crates brought
all the way from King's Landing.

353
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,398
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

354
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,233
He's so kind.

355
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:53,235
He really cares for you.

356
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:56,205
Think where you'd
be without him.

357
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,574
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

358
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:02,628
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

359
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:04,246
He feels responsible for you.

360
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:05,881
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

361
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,750
Why?

362
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:10,586
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

363
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:13,506
Well, I'm half Tully.

364
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:16,092
- He loved your family so much.
- Loved your mother.

365
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:18,094
- No.
- That's what you wanted to say.

366
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:19,562
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

367
00:24:19,596 --> 00:24:21,680
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

368
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:24,650
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

369
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:27,737
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

370
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:30,740
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

371
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:33,275
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

372
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:35,528
And your mother
loved him anyway.

373
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,198
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

374
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:41,951
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

375
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:45,004
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

376
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,957
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

377
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,793
He hasn't told you about the vile
things they do with their bodies?

378
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:53,012
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

379
00:24:53,046 --> 00:24:55,264
- <i> No, never.</i>
- Are you pregnant?

380
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,685
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never...

381
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,604
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

382
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:03,689
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

383
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,275
- Aunt Lysa, no, I...
- Your young, pretty body.

384
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,978
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

385
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,314
You're hurting me.

386
00:25:12,316 --> 00:25:13,816
I'll know if you lie.

387
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:16,652
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

388
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:18,487
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

389
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,489
All he says is that I'm stupid.

390
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,491
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

391
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,410
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

392
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:25,782
so I should always
tell the truth.

393
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,047
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

394
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:30,549
- Not once, not ever.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

395
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:34,170
It's all right.

396
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,338
It will all be all right.

397
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:37,673
You'll be a widow soon.

398
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:40,092
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

399
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:42,344
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

400
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,513
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

401
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:46,932
Hmm.

402
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:11,207
Didn't they teach you
how to ride a horse?

403
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:14,760
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

404
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:16,795
There wasn't much call for
it with Lord Tyrion, though.

405
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:19,431
He preferred litters.

406
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:22,184
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

407
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:30,476
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

408
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:33,946
It could take weeks to get to the
Wall, depending on the weather.

409
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,648
That's a long way off.

410
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:38,651
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

411
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:41,237
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

412
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:43,822
Feel free to stop at any point.

413
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:46,742
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

414
00:26:46,793 --> 00:26:49,328
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

415
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,796
I don't see why I need one now.

416
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,581
All knights have
squires, my lady.

417
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,916
<i>I'm not a knight.</i>

418
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:57,086
And I'm not a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

419
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,255
I swore an oath, my lady.

420
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:01,807
I am releasing you
from that oath.

421
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:07,062
That means you could leave.

422
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:08,847
I know.

423
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:11,400
What do you think
will happen if you leave?

424
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:15,271
They'll say I wasn't
a very good squire.

425
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:13,128
- The hell you doing?
- Practicing.

426
00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:16,382
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

427
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,334
They will if you nance
around like that.

428
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:20,836
That's no way to fight.

429
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,839
It's not fighting.
It's water dancing.

430
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,975
Dancing?

431
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,227
Maybe you ought
to put on a dress.

432
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:32,014
Who taught you that shite?

433
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:34,650
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

434
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,522
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

435
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:41,991
Braavos.

436
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,859
Greasy-haired little
bastard, I bet.

437
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:45,244
They all are.

438
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:46,862
What do you know about anything?

439
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:49,031
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

440
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,083
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

441
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:52,034
- Yes.
- How?

442
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:53,952
- He was killed.
- Who by?

443
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:55,788
Meryn Trant.
That's why Ser Meryn...

444
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,539
Meryn Trant?

445
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,759
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

446
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:02,761
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

447
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:04,713
could beat three Meryn Trants.

448
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:07,182
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armor. Just a stick.

449
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:09,385
The greatest swordsman who ever
lived didn't have a sword?

450
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,722
All right.
You have a sword.

451
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,190
Let's see what he taught you.

452
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:18,060
Go on, do it for
your Braavosi friend.

453
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:21,313
Dead like all the rest
of your friends.

454
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:36,078
Your friend's dead
and Meryn Trant's not

455
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,830
'cause Trant had armor

456
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:40,215
and a big fucking sword.

457
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:12,364
Your Grace.

458
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:15,084
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?

459
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:17,870
A poem, actually.

460
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:21,123
May I show you the gardens?

461
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:24,259
I couldn't very well
refuse a royal escort.

462
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:26,462
No, you couldn't.

463
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,966
I didn't realize
you were a poet.

464
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:33,635
Not a very good one.

465
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:35,721
For your paramour?

466
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:38,107
For one of my daughters.

467
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:40,559
You have several, don't you?

468
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,944
Eight.

469
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:43,645
Eight?

470
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:45,948
Eight daughters?

471
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,816
The fifth is difficult.

472
00:30:47,867 --> 00:30:50,486
I named her after
my sister Elia.

473
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,154
Beautiful name.

474
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:54,072
Yes.

475
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:57,159
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

476
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,129
And after I turn sad,

477
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:02,331
I grow angry.

478
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,083
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

479
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:08,220
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

480
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:10,506
Which joke is that?

481
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:12,925
You're a prince of Dorne.

482
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:15,177
A legendary fighter.

483
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:17,396
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

484
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,349
But you could not
save your sister.

485
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,819
I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

486
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:25,988
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

487
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:28,690
But I could not save my son.

488
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:31,160
What good is power

489
00:31:31,194 --> 00:31:34,196
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

490
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:36,031
We can avenge them.

491
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,534
Yes, we can avenge them.

492
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,754
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

493
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:46,008
I know he did.

494
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,495
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

495
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,881
We'll have a trial, anyway.

496
00:31:57,053 --> 00:32:00,556
I haven't seen my
daughter in over a year.

497
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:02,558
The last time I saw her,

498
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,894
she was swimming with two of
my girls in the Water Gardens.

499
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,730
Laughing in the sun.

500
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:12,734
I want to believe that.

501
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:15,571
I want to believe she's happy.

502
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:18,207
You have my word.

503
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:21,076
We don't hurt
little girls in Dorne.

504
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:25,547
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

505
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:36,725
Would you bring her
a gift for me?

506
00:32:38,595 --> 00:32:40,395
<i>I wasn't there for her name day.</i>

507
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,764
I don't know when
I'll see her again.

508
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:45,234
Anything at all.

509
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:48,520
The best shipwrights
in King's Landing

510
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:50,689
have been working
on it for months.

511
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,159
Myrcella loves the open water.

512
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:58,330
<i>I will have it sailed
down to Sunspear for her.</i>

513
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:01,717
Please tell her...

514
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,455
her mother misses her very much.

515
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:17,933
Oh, no, no, no.

516
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:19,885
No, no, no, no.

517
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,354
Hells.

518
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:27,526
Gods.

519
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,481
Did you remove the skin?

520
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,118
No, my lady.

521
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:38,120
Have you ever cooked
a rabbit before?

522
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:40,489
No, my lady.

523
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,326
Did you ever cook
anything for Lord Tyrion?

524
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:47,296
No, my lady.

525
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,047
That was the cooks.

526
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:07,766
What are you doing?

527
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,018
I'm helping you with your armor.

528
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,322
I've been removing my own armor for
quite some time, thank you very much.

529
00:34:31,124 --> 00:34:33,759
What exactly did you do
for Lord Tyrion?

530
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:37,346
I brought him his meals and cleared
his table when he was finished.

531
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,681
I kept his clothing
and linens clean.

532
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:42,634
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

533
00:34:44,437 --> 00:34:46,138
Mostly I poured wine.

534
00:34:46,189 --> 00:34:48,190
Oh.

535
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,058
Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,

536
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,478
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

537
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,035
I killed a man.

538
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:05,240
Who?

539
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,292
A Kingsguard.

540
00:35:11,164 --> 00:35:14,583
He tried to kill
Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

541
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,422
How did you kill a Kingsguard?

542
00:35:22,258 --> 00:35:24,976
I pushed a spear through
the back of his head.

543
00:35:36,823 --> 00:35:38,940
Bloody ridiculous.

544
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:44,279
Help me with these straps.

545
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:05,267
Hey.

546
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,302
Hey, get up.

547
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:11,273
Get up.

548
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,147
<i>That's it lad,
put it inside.</i>

549
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:21,149
<i>Get the fire going again.</i>
<i>We're all freezing.</i>

550
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,652
Aye. What we need
is a girl there.

551
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:25,821
I've got to have a piss.

552
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:40,719
Now keep quiet.

553
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:23,545
You need water.

554
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,263
It doesn't matter.

555
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:28,316
Of course it matters.

556
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,588
You mustn't let
anything stop you.

557
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:38,226
They already have stopped me.

558
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,862
No.

559
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:45,433
You're not here.

560
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:53,408
You're far from here.

561
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:57,579
What does that mean?

562
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:05,670
At the hill.

563
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:08,340
A great weirwood tree.

564
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:13,311
You've seen it, too.

565
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:17,566
Meera and I, even Hodor,

566
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,235
we're only here to guide you.

567
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,807
He's waiting for you.

568
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,911
We have to find it.

569
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,582
You have to make it.

570
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:35,216
We will.

571
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:39,738
This... this isn't
the end.

572
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:43,024
Not for you.

573
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,877
Not yet.

574
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:48,396
<i>How...</i>

575
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:51,132
will we know the end?

576
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:05,280
You'll know.

577
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,211
<i>Brothers.</i>

578
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:22,964
You do move quiet.

579
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:27,335
- How many?
- 11 men.

580
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:29,220
Most of them already drunk.

581
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:33,141
No guards posted. They don't seem
to have a care in the world.

582
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:36,177
We'll carve them up
like walnut pie.

583
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:38,680
Karl was a top paid
cutthroat in Flea Bottom.

584
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:40,982
I've seen what
he can do with a knife.

585
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:42,767
Have you seen what
I can do with a knife?

586
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:45,320
Not yet.

587
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:51,026
There's a hut on the west side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

588
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:52,243
Why?

589
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:55,363
They've got some hounds
chained up inside.

590
00:39:55,414 --> 00:39:58,533
Closer we can get without the
dogs sniffing us, the better.

591
00:40:00,036 --> 00:40:02,370
New moon tonight.

592
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,708
Get some rest.

593
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:09,377
We move at sundown.

594
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,682
I've always liked
a girl with curls.

595
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:15,850
A touch of class.

596
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:18,386
You take whatever's left.

597
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:22,974
Get her up.

598
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:26,361
<i>Stop.</i>

599
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:28,029
<i>Stop.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

600
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:30,281
<i>Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.</i>

601
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:33,118
Stop.
Stop!

602
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:37,539
<i>- Hodor. Hodor.</i>
<i>- Stop!</i>

603
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:40,125
- Please.
- <i> Hodor.</i>

604
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,411
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor. Hodor.

605
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:45,747
Please!
Please, leave her alone!

606
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:50,719
<i>Please, stop. Stop.</i>

607
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:54,005
- <i> What are you doing? Leave her alone!</i>
- <i> Hodor. Hodor.</i>

608
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:55,557
- <i> No!</i>
- Shh.

609
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:58,593
Shh, shh, shh.

610
00:40:58,644 --> 00:41:01,429
Shh.

611
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:07,435
You've got pretty hair,
don't you?

612
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:12,440
Now what is a pretty little
highborn girl like you

613
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:15,410
doing out here in
the deep, dark woods, eh?

614
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,832
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

615
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:23,118
No dresses for you.

616
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,621
You like it rough, don't you?

617
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:29,958
You like it in
the gutter, don't you?

618
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:33,344
If you let my sister go,
I can help you.

619
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,714
You can help me?

620
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:39,134
I can.

621
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,804
And how you gonna do that?

622
00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:49,394
I have the sight.
I can see things.

623
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:51,312
That's very helpful.

624
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:53,565
Things that haven't
happened yet.

625
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:59,454
What a fine thing.

626
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:04,375
A fine thing.

627
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:09,214
Have you seen what I'm
gonna do to your sister?

628
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:15,770
Have you seen what they're
going to do to your sister?

629
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,974
No.

630
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:24,596
Don't close your eyes.

631
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:32,520
I saw you die tonight.

632
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,858
I saw your body burn.

633
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:41,362
I saw the snow fall
and bury your bones.

634
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,784
<i>To arms!</i>

635
00:42:46,836 --> 00:42:49,871
They're here, the Night's Watch.

636
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:21,402
Rescue party is here, lads.

637
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:22,954
Lady.

638
00:43:23,038 --> 00:43:25,623
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

639
00:43:25,658 --> 00:43:28,293
I'll take you to him.

640
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:33,381
You're Brandon Stark?

641
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,138
Hodor. Hodor.

642
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:42,840
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

643
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:44,676
Jon! Jon!

644
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:49,097
Keep talking and I'll cut
your friends' throats.

645
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:52,016
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?

646
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:54,185
Do you hear?

647
00:44:06,615 --> 00:44:08,833
<i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>

648
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:12,670
Hodor. Hodor.

649
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,455
Hodor. Hodor.

650
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:19,677
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>
<i>Hodor.</i>

651
00:45:02,504 --> 00:45:04,505
Hodor.

652
00:45:05,674 --> 00:45:09,227
<i>Hodor, get his knife.</i>
<i>Cut me loose.</i>

653
00:45:10,312 --> 00:45:13,431
- <i> Hodor, get his knife.</i>
- Hodor.

654
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,985
Cut me loose, Hodor.

655
00:45:22,941 --> 00:45:26,110
Jojen and Meera, free them.

656
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:27,862
<i>Go!</i>

657
00:45:30,616 --> 00:45:32,333
Jon.

658
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:44,045
Jon!

659
00:45:46,131 --> 00:45:47,715
If he sees you, he won't
let you go north.

660
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:50,768
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

661
00:45:50,803 --> 00:45:53,638
<i>He'll take you back</i>
<i>to Castle Black.</i>

662
00:45:55,224 --> 00:45:57,275
<i>You have to decide.</i>

663
00:45:57,309 --> 00:45:59,310
Do you want to find
the three-eyed raven?

664
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:15,626
- Hodor.
- Hodor.

665
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,879
We need to free Summer.

666
00:46:17,913 --> 00:46:20,548
And we need to go.

667
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:37,098
Lord Snow.

668
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,684
Are you bringing me
back for trial?

669
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,439
We had a good thing here.

670
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,358
We were free men.

671
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,527
You'll never be free.

672
00:46:49,578 --> 00:46:51,946
You'll never know
what that's like.

673
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:15,970
You learn how to fight
in a castle?

674
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:23,277
Some old man
teach you how to stand,

675
00:47:23,312 --> 00:47:24,645
how to parry?

676
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:30,902
How to fight with honor?

677
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,800
You know what's
wrong with honor?

678
00:47:56,478 --> 00:47:58,312
You.

679
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:32,263
Are you all right?

680
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:36,801
Come with me.

681
00:48:36,852 --> 00:48:38,970
Come on.

682
00:48:55,654 --> 00:48:57,872
We lost four brothers?

683
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,907
Five.

684
00:49:03,378 --> 00:49:05,713
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

685
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:10,167
I count 10 dead mutineers.

686
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:13,421
Locke said there
were 11 of them.

687
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,340
Where's Rast?

688
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:02,970
- Here's another.
- Jon.

689
00:50:05,974 --> 00:50:07,942
<i>Where in seven hells?</i>

690
00:50:09,144 --> 00:50:10,478
Come here.

691
00:50:17,786 --> 00:50:20,037
I missed you, boy.

692
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,826
What should we do with this lot?

693
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:33,000
It's not safe for you
here on your own.

694
00:50:33,002 --> 00:50:35,636
Mance Rayder has an army
heading this way

695
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:37,672
and there's worse out
there than Mance.

696
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:42,677
Come with us to Castle Black.

697
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:46,097
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.

698
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:48,349
Meaning all respect, Ser Crow,

699
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,986
Craster beat us and worse.

700
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,489
Your brother crows
beat us and worse.

701
00:50:55,524 --> 00:50:57,692
We'll find our own way.

702
00:50:57,694 --> 00:50:59,276
You want to stay here

703
00:50:59,328 --> 00:51:01,445
in Craster's Keep?

704
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,618
Burn it to the ground

705
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:10,538
and all the dead with it.

706
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:59,786
