1
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,434
Easy, boy.

2
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,194
What do you expect?
They're savages.

3
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,961
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,

4
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,363
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,963
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

6
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,398
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

7
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,046
How close did you get?

8
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:29,978
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

9
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,296
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,578
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

11
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:37,828
We tracked them.

12
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,095
They won't trouble us no more.

13
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,421
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?

14
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,101
Get back on your horse.

15
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,090
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

16
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,026
They even killed the children.

17
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,044
It's a good thing we're not children.

18
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,242
You want to run away south, run away.

19
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,141
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

20
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,455
if I don't catch you first.

21
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,744
Get back on your horse.

22
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:14,093
I won't say it again.

23
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,204
Your dead men
seem to have moved camp.

24
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:50,243
They were here.

25
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,579
See where they went.

26
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:43,678
What is it?

27
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:46,429
It's...

28
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,320
-= La Fabrique =-
www.sous-titres.eu

29
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,506
Go on,

30
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,966
father's watching.

31
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:55,887
And your mother.

32
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,936
Fine work as always.
Well done.

33
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,062
Thank you.

34
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,263
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

35
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:12,875
Quite beautiful.

36
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,180
The stitching...

37
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,972
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

38
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:41,557
Keep practicing, Bran.

39
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:45,148
Go on.

40
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,244
Don't think too much, Bran.

41
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,750
Relax your bow arm.

42
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:06,666
Quick, Bran!
Faster.

43
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,559
Lord Stark!

44
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,924
My lady.

45
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,816
A guardsman just rode in
from the hills.

46
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,817
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

47
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,398
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

48
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:26,887
Do you have to?

49
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,462
He swore an oath, Cat.

50
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,380
The law is law, my lady.

51
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,652
Tell Bran he's coming too.

52
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:37,796
Ned.

53
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,116
10 is too young to see such things.

54
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:42,285
He won't be a boy forever.

55
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,283
And winter is coming.

56
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,068
White walkers.

57
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,506
I saw the white walkers.

58
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:19,734
White walkers.

59
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,778
The white walkers, I saw them.

60
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:33,461
I know I broke my oath.

61
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,214
And I know I'm a deserter.

62
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,980
I should have gone back to the wall
and warned them, but...

63
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,374
I saw what I saw.

64
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:44,555
I saw the white walkers.

65
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,309
People need to know.

66
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:52,438
If you can get word to my family...

67
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,694
Tell them I'm no coward.

68
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:56,614
Tell them I'm sorry.

69
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,317
Forgive me, lord.

70
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,433
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

71
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,639
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

72
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:27,265
- King of the Andals and the First Men.
- Father will know if you do.

73
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,323
... Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

74
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,301
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

75
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,399
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

76
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,860
sentence you to die.

77
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:55,040
You did well.

78
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,031
You understand why I did it?

79
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:27,074
Jon said he was a deserter.

80
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,702
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

81
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,370
"Our way is the old way"?

82
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:36,709
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

83
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,792
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

84
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:45,134
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

85
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,845
So he was lying?

86
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,383
A madman sees what he sees.

87
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:21,892
What is it?

88
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,367
Mountain lion?

89
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:30,775
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

90
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:17,747
It's a freak!

91
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,896
It's a direwolf.

92
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,722
Tough old beast.

93
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:36,787
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

94
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:38,956
Now there are five.

95
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,500
You want to hold it?

96
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,340
Where will they go?

97
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:50,217
Their mother's dead.

98
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,885
They don't belong down here.

99
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,429
Better a quick death.

100
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:57,558
- They won't last without their mother.
- Right. Give it here.

101
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,772
Put away your blade.

102
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,757
I take orders from your father,
not you.

103
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:02,813
Please, father!

104
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,774
- I'm sorry, Bran.
- Lord Stark?

105
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,590
There are five pups...

106
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,945
One for each of the Stark children.

107
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,159
The direwolf is
the sigil of your house.

108
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:18,272
They were meant to have them.

109
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:25,502
You will train them yourselves.

110
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,462
You will feed them yourselves.

111
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,175
And if they die, you will
bury them yourselves.

112
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,518
What about you?

113
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,146
I'm not a Stark.

114
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:45,917
Get on.

115
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:57,743
What is it?

116
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,582
The runt of the litter...

117
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,501
That one's yours, Snow.

118
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,590
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you:

119
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,444
You worry too much.
It's starting to show.

120
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,333
And you never worry about anything.

121
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,868
When we were seven and you jumped
off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

122
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:25,372
100-foot drop into the water,
and you were never afraid.

123
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,125
There was nothing to be afraid
of until you told father.

124
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,185
"We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

125
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:37,676
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

126
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,604
- My husband.
- If he told the king,

127
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:44,057
both our heads would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

128
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:49,254
Whatever Jon Arryn knew
or didn't know, it died with him.

129
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:52,409
And Robert will choose a new Hand
of the King, someone to do his job

130
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,709
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores...

131
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,920
Or is it the other way around?

132
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:00,949
And life will go on.

133
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:03,535
You should be the Hand of the King.

134
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:06,314
That's an honor I can do without.

135
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,089
Their days are too long,

136
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,514
their lives are too short.

137
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:53,648
All these years and I still feel like
an outsider when I come here.

138
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,381
You have five northern children.

139
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,677
You're not an outsider.

140
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,103
I wonder if the old gods agree.

141
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,401
It's your gods with all the rules.

142
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,940
I am so sorry, my love.

143
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,028
Tell me.

144
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,061
There was a raven
from King's Landing.

145
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,241
Jon Arryn is dead.

146
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,561
A fever took him.

147
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,832
I know he was like a father to you.

148
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:38,088
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

149
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,447
gods be good.

150
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:51,727
The raven brought more news...

151
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,179
The king rides for Winterfell...

152
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:00,105
With the queen
and all the rest of them.

153
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,406
If he's coming this far north...

154
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,992
There's only one thing he's after.

155
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,743
You can always say no, Ned.

156
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:22,347
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

157
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:26,494
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

158
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:30,581
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his... stature?

159
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:34,421
We've brought up eight barrels
of ale from the cellar.

160
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:38,108
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case, candles.

161
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:46,716
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the king?

162
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,409
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

163
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,787
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

164
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,290
Think of all those southern girls he
gets to stab with his right royal prick.

165
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,392
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

166
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:01,838
He's never met a girl
he likes better than his own hair.

167
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,968
Gods, but they grow fast.

168
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,598
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

169
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:51,941
How many times
have I told you no climbing?

170
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,016
But he's coming right now,
down our road.

171
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,818
I want you to promise me,

172
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,028
no more climbing.

173
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:12,034
I promise.

174
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,579
Do you know what?

175
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:17,372
What?

176
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,708
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

177
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,630
Run and find your father.
Tell him the king is close.

178
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:13,372
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

179
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,270
What are you doing with that on?

180
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,551
Go on.

181
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:34,616
Move!

182
00:26:58,231 --> 00:26:59,281
Your Grace.

183
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,707
You've got fat.

184
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,102
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?

185
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,772
- Where the hell have you been?
- Guarding the north for you.

186
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,133
Winterfell is yours.

187
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:37,178
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

188
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:38,698
Who have we here?

189
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,147
You must be Robb.

190
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:46,493
My, you're a pretty one.

191
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,834
Your name is?

192
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,294
Arya.

193
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,667
Show us your muscles.

194
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,677
You'll be a soldier.

195
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,948
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

196
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,309
Would you please shut up?

197
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:17,405
My queen.

198
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,251
My queen.

199
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,974
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

200
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:23,743
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

201
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:25,996
Surely the dead can wait.

202
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:27,704
Ned.

203
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:39,427
Where's the Imp?

204
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,294
Where is our brother?

205
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:46,474
Go and find the little beast.

206
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:50,143
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

207
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,939
One minute he was fine and then...

208
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:57,663
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

209
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,336
I loved that man.

210
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:02,365
We both did.

211
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,450
He never had to teach you much,
but me?

212
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:06,870
You remember me at 16?

213
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:11,368
All I wanted to do
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

214
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:14,007
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

215
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,256
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

216
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:23,666
I need you, Ned...

217
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:27,849
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

218
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,519
Lord Eddard Stark,

219
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:34,965
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

220
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,173
I'm not worthy of the honor.

221
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:45,112
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

222
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:49,034
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

223
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:50,757
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

224
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:56,464
You helped me win the Iron Throne,
now help me keep the damn thing.

225
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,712
We were meant to rule together.

226
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:03,782
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

227
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,335
Well, it's not too late.

228
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:09,349
I have a son, you have a daughter.

229
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:13,406
We'll join our houses.

230
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:41,101
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

231
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,611
Did you hear
the king's in Winterfell?

232
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,476
I did hear something about that.

233
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,028
And the queen and her twin brother.

234
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,898
They say that he is the most handsome
man in the Seven Kingdoms.

235
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,469
And the other brother?

236
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,072
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

237
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,031
and there's the clever one.

238
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,334
I hear they call him the Imp.

239
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:14,930
I hear he hates that nickname.

240
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:17,824
I hear he's more than earned it.

241
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,411
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

242
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:22,714
prone to all manner of perversions.

243
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,176
Clever girl.

244
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:28,887
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

245
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:30,703
Have you?

246
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:32,697
Already?

247
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:38,062
The gods gave me one blessing.

248
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:44,695
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

249
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:48,657
Should I explain to you the meaning
of a closed door in a whorehouse,

250
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:49,624
brother?

251
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,703
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

252
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,139
but our sister craves your attention.

253
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:57,624
She has odd cravings, our sister.

254
00:31:58,134 --> 00:31:59,289
A family trait.

255
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,338
Now the Starks are feasting us
at sundown.

256
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:05,142
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

257
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,384
I'm sorry, I've begun
the feast a bit early.

258
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:10,762
And this is the first
of many courses.

259
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:13,352
I thought you might say that.

260
00:32:13,477 --> 00:32:15,350
But since we're short on time...

261
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,446
Come on, girls.

262
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,065
See you at sundown.

263
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:26,753
Close the door!

264
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:42,335
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

265
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:46,548
She should be on a hill somewhere

266
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,180
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

267
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,869
She was my sister.

268
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:53,217
This is where she belongs.

269
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:55,909
She belonged with me.

270
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:05,108
In my dreams, I kill him every night.

271
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,888
It's done, Your Grace.

272
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,261
The Targaryens are gone.

273
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:15,560
Not all of them.

274
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,992
Daenerys!

275
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:33,556
Daenerys.

276
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:35,723
There's our bride-to-be.

277
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,149
Look,

278
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,877
a gift from Illyrio.

279
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:42,408
Touch it.

280
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:45,029
Go on, feel the fabric.

281
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:55,316
Isn't he a gracious host?

282
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:02,123
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

283
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:03,873
Illyrio's no fool.

284
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,878
He knows I won't forget my friends
when I come into my throne.

285
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:14,249
You still slouch.

286
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,729
Let them see.

287
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,260
You have a woman's body now.

288
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:46,428
I need you to be perfect today.

289
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:51,007
Can you do that for me?

290
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,553
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

291
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,556
No.

292
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,580
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

293
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:11,467
they will say it began today.

294
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,045
It's too hot, my lady.

295
00:35:58,566 --> 00:35:59,753
Where is he?

296
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:02,899
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

297
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,472
May I present my honored guests?

298
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:26,142
Viserys of House Targaryen,

299
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:27,991
the third of his name,

300
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:30,975
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

301
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:32,806
and his sister

302
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:35,527
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

303
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,115
Do you see how long his hair is?

304
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,072
When Dothraki are defeated in combat,

305
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:47,787
they cut off their braids so the whole
world can see their shame.

306
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:51,610
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

307
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:56,722
He's a savage, of course,
but one of the finest killers alive.

308
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,391
And you will be his queen.

309
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:02,961
Come forward, my dear.

310
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,603
Where is he going?!

311
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,300
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

312
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:48,558
Did he like her?

313
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,109
Trust me, Your Grace,

314
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,024
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

315
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:57,097
It won't be long now.

316
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,832
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea
and take back your father's throne.

317
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,107
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

318
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,899
They cry out for their true king.

319
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:14,426
When will they be married?

320
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:15,808
Soon.

321
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:18,385
The Dothraki
never stay still for long.

322
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,631
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

323
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,413
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

324
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,469
Do you take me for a fool?

325
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:27,692
I take you for a king.

326
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,884
Kings lack the caution of common men.

327
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,099
My apologies if I've given offense.

328
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:35,443
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

329
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:37,774
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

330
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,444
I don't want to be his queen.

331
00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:47,909
I want to go home.

332
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,822
So do I.

333
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,437
I want us both to go home,

334
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,972
but they took it from us.

335
00:38:56,097 --> 00:38:57,547
So tell me, sweet sister,

336
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,362
how do we go home?

337
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,341
I don't know.

338
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,898
We go home with an army.

339
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,019
With Khal Drogo's army.

340
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:14,034
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you...

341
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:17,717
All 40,000 men and their horses too

342
00:39:17,842 --> 00:39:19,273
if that's what it took.

343
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,875
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

344
00:39:39,604 --> 00:39:41,165
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

345
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:45,162
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

346
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,012
He's so handsome.

347
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:52,932
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

348
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,000
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

349
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:57,937
Why would he say no?

350
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:01,168
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

351
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:03,317
He'd have to leave home.

352
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,186
He'd have to leave me.

353
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,275
And so would you.

354
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,164
You left your home to come here.

355
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,350
And I'd be queen someday.

356
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:17,904
Please make father say yes!

357
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:19,825
- Sansa...
- Please please!

358
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,037
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

359
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,011
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

360
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:00,833
Is he dead yet?

361
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:07,235
Uncle Benjen.

362
00:41:10,408 --> 00:41:11,495
You got bigger.

363
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:14,491
Rode all day.

364
00:41:15,012 --> 00:41:17,225
Didn't want to leave
you alone with the Lannisters.

365
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,537
Why aren't you at the feast?

366
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:21,785
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

367
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,700
to seat a bastard in their midst.

368
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:27,063
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

369
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:29,340
No bastard was ever refused
a seat there.

370
00:41:29,465 --> 00:41:31,830
So take me with you when you go back.

371
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:34,826
Father will let me if you ask him.
I know he will.

372
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,241
The wall isn't going anywhere.

373
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,376
I'm ready to swear your oath.

374
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:46,446
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

375
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:48,454
We have no families.

376
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,101
- None of us will ever father sons...
- I don't care about that!

377
00:41:53,028 --> 00:41:55,513
You might, if you knew what it meant.

378
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:00,981
I'd better get inside,

379
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:03,890
rescue your father from his guests.

380
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,144
We'll talk later.

381
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:19,331
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

382
00:42:22,704 --> 00:42:24,334
What are you doing back there?

383
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:27,701
Preparing for a night
with your family.

384
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:34,526
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

385
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:36,387
You're Tyrion Lannister,

386
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:40,091
- the queen's brother?
- My greatest accomplishment.

387
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,936
And you...
you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

388
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:49,567
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

389
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,689
You are the bastard though.

390
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,611
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

391
00:42:59,134 --> 00:43:01,204
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

392
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:03,956
making you the bastard.

393
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,716
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

394
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:11,817
Never forget what you are.

395
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,826
The rest of the world will not.

396
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,249
Wear it like armor

397
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:18,906
and it can never be used to hurt you.

398
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,722
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

399
00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:28,439
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

400
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:52,032
You at a feast...

401
00:43:52,832 --> 00:43:54,580
It's like a bear in a trap.

402
00:43:56,556 --> 00:43:58,007
The boy I beheaded...

403
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:02,223
- Did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

404
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,200
And he was tough, Ned,

405
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,186
a true ranger.

406
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,642
He was talking madness.

407
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:13,584
Said the walkers
slaughtered his friends.

408
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,733
The two he was with
are still missing.

409
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,544
A wildling ambush.

410
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:22,952
Maybe.

411
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:26,473
Direwolves south of the Wall,

412
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,903
talk of the walkers,

413
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:32,220
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

414
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:34,556
Winter is coming.

415
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:38,133
Winter is coming.

416
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,125
Uncle Benjen.

417
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,811
Robb boy.

418
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:44,473
- How are you?
- I'm good.

419
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:50,357
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

420
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:53,441
Lovely country.

421
00:44:57,378 --> 00:45:00,531
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

422
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:04,744
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

423
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:06,203
up here for the first time.

424
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:09,808
Hello, little dove.

425
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:12,718
But you are a beauty.

426
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,713
- How old are you?
- 13, Your Grace.

427
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:17,270
You're tall.

428
00:45:17,898 --> 00:45:18,990
Still growing?

429
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:20,384
I think so, Your Grace.

430
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:22,553
And have you bled yet?

431
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:29,143
No, Your Grace.

432
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:32,229
Your dress, did you make it?

433
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:37,318
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

434
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:42,166
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

435
00:45:43,522 --> 00:45:44,575
I hear the same.

436
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,872
Your daughter will do well
in the Capital.

437
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:50,075
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

438
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:08,184
Your pardon.

439
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,976
I hear we might be neighbors soon.
I hope it's true.

440
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:13,661
The king has honored me
with his offer.

441
00:46:13,786 --> 00:46:16,941
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to
celebrate your new title, if you accept.

442
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,193
It would be good
to have you on the field.

443
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:21,352
The competition
has become a bit stale.

444
00:46:21,914 --> 00:46:23,881
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

445
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,741
Getting a little old for it?

446
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:29,480
I don't fight in tournaments

447
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:31,865
because when I fight a man for real

448
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:33,999
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

449
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:37,628
Well said.

450
00:46:39,778 --> 00:46:40,933
Arya!

451
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:44,305
It's not funny!

452
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:46,736
She always does this.

453
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,191
This was my favorite dress.

454
00:46:49,878 --> 00:46:52,354
She always does it
and it's not funny!

455
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:53,849
Time for bed.

456
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:06,710
I'm a Northman.

457
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,809
I belong here with you,
not down south

458
00:47:10,934 --> 00:47:13,131
in that rats' nest
they call a Capital.

459
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:16,815
I won't let him take you.

460
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,439
The king takes what he wants.

461
00:47:22,278 --> 00:47:23,666
That's why he's king.

462
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:25,839
I'll say,

463
00:47:26,725 --> 00:47:28,599
"Listen, fat man."

464
00:47:29,814 --> 00:47:32,301
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

465
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:34,846
"He belongs to me now."

466
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,392
How did he get so fat?

467
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:43,679
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

468
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:48,682
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

469
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,905
Send him in.

470
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:56,676
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

471
00:47:57,998 --> 00:47:59,810
A rider in the night...

472
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:01,212
From your sister.

473
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:10,831
Stay.

474
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:12,555
This was sent from the Eyrie.

475
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:20,121
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

476
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:22,942
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

477
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:32,962
What news?

478
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:37,117
She's fled the Capital.

479
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:42,628
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

480
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:44,672
By the Lannisters.

481
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:46,748
She says the king is in danger.

482
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:49,372
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

483
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,841
She doesn't know what she's saying.

484
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:54,226
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

485
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,451
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

486
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,427
Do you think
she would risk her life...

487
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:00,938
her son's life...

488
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,221
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

489
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:13,623
If this news is true

490
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:16,558
and the Lannisters
conspire against the Throne,

491
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:19,504
who but you can protect the king?

492
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,052
They murdered the last Hand.

493
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:24,266
Now you want Ned to take the job?

494
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,103
The king rode for a month

495
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,471
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

496
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:30,515
He's the only one he trusts.

497
00:49:32,776 --> 00:49:34,750
You swore the king an oath, my Lord.

498
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,958
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

499
00:49:39,478 --> 00:49:40,818
He owes him nothing.

500
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:46,299
Your father and brother
rode south once

501
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:48,535
on a king's demand.

502
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,592
A different time.

503
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:55,912
A different king.

504
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,392
When do I meet with the Khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

505
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,353
If Khal Drogo
has promised you a crown,

506
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:06,159
- you shall have it.
- When?

507
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:08,023
When their omens favor war.

508
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:11,539
I piss on Dothraki omens.

509
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,447
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

510
00:52:14,555 --> 00:52:15,890
A Dothraki wedding

511
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:19,153
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

512
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:44,826
A small gift, for the new Khaleesi...

513
00:52:45,907 --> 00:52:48,718
Songs and Histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

514
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,418
Thank you, Ser.

515
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:55,688
Are you from my country?

516
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,922
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

517
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,845
I served your father for many years.

518
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:03,848
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful king.

519
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:28,998
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

520
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:32,449
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

521
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:35,796
The ages have turned them to stone,

522
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,798
but they will always be beautiful.

523
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,014
Thank you, magister.

524
00:54:50,511 --> 00:54:52,456
She's beautiful.

525
00:54:56,937 --> 00:55:00,047
Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say
thank you in Dothraki.

526
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:03,759
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

527
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,417
Make him happy.

528
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:27,679
No.

529
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:33,515
Do you know the common tongue?

530
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:40,609
No.

531
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,632
Is "no" the only word that you know?

532
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:49,281
No.

533
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:19,409
Rough night, Imp?

534
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,048
If I get through this
without squirting

535
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:24,518
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

536
00:57:25,378 --> 00:57:27,081
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

537
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:29,853
The greatest in the land...
my spear never misses.

538
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:33,168
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

539
00:57:42,274 --> 00:57:44,169
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

540
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:46,755
No, but I'm still better than you.

541
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:53,039
I know what I'm putting you through.
Thank you for saying yes.

542
00:57:55,545 --> 00:57:57,340
I only ask you because I need you.

543
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:00,559
You're a loyal friend.

544
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:01,951
You hear me?

545
00:58:02,773 --> 00:58:04,022
A loyal friend.

546
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:06,317
The last one I've got.

547
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:09,928
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

548
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:14,298
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

549
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:17,744
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

550
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:29,370
Come on, you.

551
00:59:53,738 --> 00:59:55,353
Are you completely mad?

552
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,812
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

553
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:00,639
He saw us!

554
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,432
I heard you the first time.

555
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,231
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

556
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:13,402
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

557
01:00:14,128 --> 01:00:15,228
10.

558
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:25,416
The things I do for love.
