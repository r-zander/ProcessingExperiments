2
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,872
The little lord's
been dreaming again.

3
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:54,351
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

4
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,218
Really?

5
00:02:56,512 --> 00:03:00,462
If I was cooped up all day with no one
but this old bat, I'd go mad.

6
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,851
You don't have a choice.

7
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,770
- Robb's waiting.
- I don't want to go.

8
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,325
Neither do I.

9
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,108
But robb's lord of Winterfell,
which means I do what he says

10
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,905
and you do what I say.

11
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,242
Hodor!

12
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,241
Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:33,770
I must say I received a slightly
warmer welcome on my last visit.

14
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,445
Any man of the night's
watch is welcome at Winterfell.

15
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,345
Any man of the night's
watch, but not I, eh, boy?

16
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,342
I'm not your boy, lannister.

17
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,444
I'm lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

18
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,310
Then you might learn
a lord's courtesy.

19
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,647
So it's true.

20
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,371
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

21
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,948
He has no memory of that day.

22
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,032
Curious.

23
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,842
Why are you here?

24
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,706
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

25
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,772
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, hodor.

26
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,586
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

27
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,068
Well, I mean I did like to.

28
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:20,082
The boy has lost the use of his legs.

29
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,639
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

30
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,683
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

31
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,769
My father will rejoice to hear it.

32
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,535
I have a gift for you.

33
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,315
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

34
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,612
You must shape the horse
to the rider.

35
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,578
Start with a yearling and teach it
to respond to the boy's voice.

36
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,535
Will I really be able to ride?

37
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,204
You will.

38
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,402
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:49,832
Is this some kind of trick?

40
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,876
Why do you want to help him?

41
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,295
I have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples,

42
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,381
bastards and broken things.

43
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,676
You've done my brother a kindness.

44
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:04,013
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
Spare me your false courtesies.

45
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:07,452
There's a brothel outside your walls.

46
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,894
There I'll find a bed and
both of us can sleep easier.

47
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,651
Couldn't resist some northern ass?

48
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,906
- If you like redheads, ask for Ros.
- Come to see me off, Greyjoy?

49
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:25,159
Kind of you. Your master
doesn't seem to like Lannisters.

50
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,196
He's not my master.

51
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:29,614
No, of course not.

52
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,749
What happened here?
Where is lady Stark?

53
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,086
- Why didn't she receive me?
- She wasn't feeling well.

54
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,963
She's not in Winterfell, is she?

55
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,007
- My lady's whereabouts...
- My lady?

56
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:43,712
Your loyalty to your captors
is touching.

57
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,230
Tell me,

58
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,141
how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

59
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,810
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

60
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:54,568
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

61
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:56,357
I believe your uncles
were responsible?

62
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,568
Must have been a pretty sight.

63
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,784
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

64
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,073
Yes, a great victory for your people.

65
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,702
- Shame how it all turned out.
- We were outnumbered 10 to one.

66
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,568
A stupid rebellion then.

67
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,956
I suppose your father realized that

68
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,004
when your brothers died in battle.

69
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,835
Now here you are,

70
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:17,795
your enemy's squire.

71
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,672
- Careful, imp.
- I've offended you.

72
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:23,009
Forgive me,
it's been a rough morning.

73
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,316
Anyway, don't despair.

74
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:30,767
I'm a disappointment to my own father
and I've learned to live with it.

75
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,603
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

76
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,742
I'll try not to wear her out.

77
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,657
Leg, shoulder, leg.

78
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,083
Left foot forward. Good.

79
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,294
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

80
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,253
What in seven hells is that?

81
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,551
They'll need an eighth hell
to fit him in.

82
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,346
Tell them your name.

83
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,057
Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill.

84
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,018
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

85
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:17,980
- I've come to take the black.
- Come to take the black pudding.

86
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,929
Well, you couldn't be any worse
than you look.

87
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,631
See what he can do.

88
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:35,873
I yield.

89
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,542
Please, no more.

90
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,292
On your feet.
Pick up your sword.

91
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:43,422
Hit him till he finds his feet.

92
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,560
It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

93
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,396
Now they send us
squealing bloody pigs.

94
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,762
Again, harder.

95
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,215
Enough!

96
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,225
He yielded.

97
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,032
Looks like the bastard's in love.

98
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,498
All right then, lord Snow,
you wish to defend your lady love,

99
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,042
Let's make it an exercise.
You two.

100
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,311
Three of you ought to be sufficient
to make lady piggy squeal.

101
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,633
All you've got to do
is get past the bastard.

102
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,680
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

103
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,373
Yield yield yield! I yield.

104
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,995
We're done for today.

105
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,619
Go clean the armory.

106
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,287
That's all you're good for.

107
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:01,459
Well fought!

108
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:02,877
Piss off.

109
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,549
Did he hurt you?

110
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,675
I've had worse.

111
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,054
Call me Sam...

112
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:14,764
If you want.

113
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:19,207
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier.

114
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:22,605
- You'll have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

115
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,880
I wanted to.

116
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,215
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

117
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,405
I'm a coward.

118
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,591
- My father always says so.
- The wall's no place for cowards.

119
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:37,912
You're right. I'm sorry.

120
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,816
I just... Wanted to thank you.

121
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,694
A bloody coward.

122
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,920
People saw us talking to him.

123
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,851
- Now they'll think we're cowards too.
- You're too stupid to be a coward.

124
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,395
You're too stupid to be a...

125
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,664
Quick now, before summer's over.

126
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,036
Come on here!

127
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,103
Vaes Dothrak

128
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,500
the city of the horselords.

129
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,723
A pile of mud.

130
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,694
Mud and shit and twigs-

131
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,237
best these savages can do.

132
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,015
These are my people now.
You shouldn't call them savages.

133
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:59,160
I'll call them what I like,
they're my people.

134
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:01,213
This is my army.

135
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,008
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

136
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,426
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

137
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,888
could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

138
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,070
The Dothraki have never crossed
the Narrow Sea.

139
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,564
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

140
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:37,948
But if they did?

141
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,620
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

142
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:45,553
but the men advising him
are different.

143
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,229
And you know these men?

144
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,406
I fought beside them once,

145
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,575
long ago.

146
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,340
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

147
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,725
He drove me from my land.

148
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,346
You sold slaves.

149
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:06,102
Why?

150
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:07,999
I had no money

151
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:09,866
and an expensive wife.

152
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:12,323
And where is she now?

153
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,694
In another place,

154
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,066
with another man.

155
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,204
- Your grace?
- Yes, my dear?

156
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,998
They call you the last dragon...

157
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,434
They do.

158
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:33,818
You have dragon's blood

159
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,407
in your veins?

160
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:38,217
It's entirely possible.

161
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,098
What happened to the dragons?

162
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:44,431
I was told
that brave men killed them all.

163
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,785
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

164
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,832
The brave men rode them.

165
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,777
Rode them from Valyria

166
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,986
to build the greatest civilization
this world has ever seen.

167
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:02,928
The breath of the greatest dragon

168
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,570
forged the iron throne,

169
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,733
which the usurper
is keeping warm for me.

170
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,578
The swords of the vanquished,

171
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:13,962
a thousand of them...

172
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:15,816
melted together

173
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,811
like so many candles.

174
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:25,218
I have always wanted to see a dragon.

175
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:29,851
There is nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

176
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,020
Really.

177
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,201
Why dragons?

178
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,605
They can fly.

179
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,444
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

180
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,251
and they're somewhere else...

181
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,946
Far away.

182
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,844
And they can kill.

183
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:48,924
Anyone

184
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,954
or anything that tries to hurt them

185
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:56,024
gets burned away to nothing...

186
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:57,827
melted...

187
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,596
like so many candles.

188
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:08,974
Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

189
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,307
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

190
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:13,700
I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

191
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,864
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

192
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,647
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

193
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:22,739
A man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

194
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,575
I've seen a man
who could change his face

195
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,967
the way that other men
change their clothes.

196
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,095
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

197
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,513
and whose ship had sails

198
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,503
of colored silk.

199
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,054
So...

200
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,090
Have you seen one?

201
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,011
A pirate ship?

202
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,876
A dragon.

203
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:53,974
No, the last one died many years
before I was born.

204
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,228
I'll tell you what I have seen:

205
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,194
their skulls.

206
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,663
They used to decorate
the throne room in the red keep.

207
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,665
When I was very young, just 3 or 4,

208
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,738
my father used to walk me down the rows
and I'd recite their names for him.

209
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,111
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

210
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,296
The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch

211
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,044
and they were all stunted and wrong.

212
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,839
Skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

213
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,654
But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

214
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,250
They got bigger

215
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:32,140
and bigger

216
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,144
and bigger.

217
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:38,517
There was Ghiscar

218
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:41,022
and Valryon,

219
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,707
Vermithrax,

220
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:45,237
Essovius,

221
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,441
Archonel,

222
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,186
Meraxes,

223
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,039
Vhagar...

224
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,166
And Balerion the dread...

225
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,168
whose fire forged

226
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,086
the Seven Kingdoms

227
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,446
into one.

228
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,213
What happened to the skulls?

229
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,102
I don't know.

230
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:21,326
The usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

231
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,547
Scattered to the wind.

232
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,824
That's very sad.

233
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,185
Yes, it is.

234
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,159
What did I buy you for?

235
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:36,789
To make me sad?

236
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,478
No, your grace.

237
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,294
To teach your sister.

238
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,574
To teach my sister
how to be a better lover?

239
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:49,301
You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

240
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:55,986
You pretty little idiot.

241
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,523
Go on then. Get on with it.

242
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,715
Someday your husband will sit there

243
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,911
and you will sit by his side.

244
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:21,068
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

245
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,380
All the lords of westeros will gather
to see the little prince...

246
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,937
What if I have a girl?

247
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:31,340
Gods be good, you'll have boys
and girls and plenty of them.

248
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,609
What if I only have girls?

249
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,678
I wouldn't worry about that.

250
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,143
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children,
all of them girls.

251
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,491
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

252
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:42,658
But what if?

253
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,163
If you only had girls,

254
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:50,654
I suppose the throne would pass
to prince Joffrey's little brother.

255
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,573
And everyone would hate me.

256
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,124
Nobody could ever hate you.

257
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:57,578
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

258
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,818
Why would you say such a thing?

259
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,581
That business with the wolves?

260
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:07,208
I've told you a hundred times...

261
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,007
- A direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

262
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,901
Do you remember your lessons?

263
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,785
Who built the Iron Throne?

264
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,346
Aegon the conqueror.

265
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:22,261
And who built the red keep?

266
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:23,729
Maegor the cruel.

267
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,647
And how many years
did it take to build...

268
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,525
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

269
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,587
They were killed
on the orders of king Aerys, yes.

270
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,157
The Mad King.

271
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,743
Commonly known as the Mad King.

272
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,121
Why were they killed?

273
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,429
You should be speak to your father
about these matters.

274
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,543
I don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

275
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:50,714
You will find it in your heart
to forgive your father.

276
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:53,425
No, I won't.

277
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:57,127
It's the Hand's tournament
that's causing all this trouble.

278
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,388
The King's tournament.

279
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,008
I assure you

280
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,248
the Hand wants no part of it.

281
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:04,789
Call it what you will,
Lord Stark, Ser,

282
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:07,647
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

283
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,793
Last night we had a tavern riot,
a brothel fire,

284
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,955
three stabbings and a drunken horse
race down the Street of Sisters.

285
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,986
Dreadful.

286
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,721
If you can't keep the king's peace,

287
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:19,743
perhaps the city watch should
be commanded by someone who can.

288
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,495
- I need more men.
- You'll get 50.

289
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:24,414
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

290
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,918
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

291
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,812
I'll also give you 20 of my guards
till the crowds have left.

292
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,052
Thank you, my Lord Hand, Ser.
They will be put to good use.

293
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:41,618
The sooner this is over, the better.

294
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:44,497
The realm prospers
from such events, my Lord.

295
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:46,377
They give the great
a chance at glory,

296
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,188
and the lowly
a respite from their woes.

297
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:51,171
And every inn in the city is full

298
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,527
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

299
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,261
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

300
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,229
Now...
If there's nothing else, my lords?

301
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,878
This heat.

302
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,518
On days like this,

303
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,883
I envy you northerners
your summer snows.

304
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,121
Until tomorrow.

305
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:21,429
I've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

306
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:23,825
Lord Arryn?

307
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:28,580
His death was
a great sadness to all of us.

308
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:31,606
I took personal charge of his care,

309
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,888
but I could not save him.

310
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:35,902
His sickness struck him

311
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,102
very hard

312
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:39,948
and very fast.

313
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,661
I saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

314
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,831
Lord Jon
often came to me for counsel.

315
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:49,541
Why?

316
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,274
I have been Grand Maester
for many years.

317
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,665
Kings and Hands
have come to me for advice since...

318
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,182
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

319
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,007
He came inquiring after a book.

320
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:04,438
A book?

321
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,516
What book?

322
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,049
I fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

323
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,565
A ponderous tome.

324
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,155
I'd like to read it.

325
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,461
"The lineages and histories

326
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:25,483
"of the great houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

327
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:29,396
"with descriptions of many high lords

328
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:32,043
"and noble ladies

329
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,252
"and their children."

330
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,980
"Harkon Umber, first of his name,

331
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,891
"born to lord Hother Umber
and lady Amaryllis Umber

332
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,403
"in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

333
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,403
"at the last hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

334
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:05,033
"and fair complected,

335
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,380
"died in his 14th year

336
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,537
"of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."

337
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:13,333
As I said, my lord, a ponderous read.

338
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:16,253
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

339
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:19,005
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

340
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,473
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

341
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,899
Did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

342
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,559
Nothing of import, my lord.

343
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,682
There was one phrase

344
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,138
he kept repeating:

345
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:34,180
"The seed is strong," I think it was.

346
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:35,977
"The seed is strong"?

347
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:37,938
What does that mean?

348
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,930
The dying mind
is a demented mind, Lord Stark.

349
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:44,537
For all the weight they're given,

350
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:48,462
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

351
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:51,811
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

352
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,398
What else could it be?

353
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:55,986
Poison.

354
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,667
A disturbing thought.

355
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,709
I don't think it likely.

356
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:04,076
The Hand was loved by all.

357
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,844
What sort of man would dare...

358
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,475
I've heard it said
that poison is a woman's weapon.

359
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,192
Women,

360
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:12,407
cravens...

361
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:14,894
and eunuchs.

362
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,232
Did you know
that lord Varys is a eunuch?

363
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:20,734
Everybody knows that.

364
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,274
Of course.

365
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,572
How that sort of person found himself

366
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,076
on the king's council,
I will never know.

367
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,771
I've taken enough of your time.

368
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,538
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honor...

369
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,869
Thank you.

370
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:37,111
I'll find my own way out.

371
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,858
Syrio says a water dancer

372
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,901
can stand on one toe for hours.

373
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:06,411
It's a hard fall down these steps.

374
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:08,828
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson

375
00:24:08,953 --> 00:24:10,492
and every lesson makes you better.

376
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,868
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats?

377
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:16,531
Syrio says.

378
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,833
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

379
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,920
They're quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

380
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,214
You have to be quick to catch them.

381
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,742
He's right about that.

382
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,550
Now that Bran's awake

383
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,241
will he come live with us?

384
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:35,913
He needs to get
his strength back first.

385
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,936
He wants to be
a knight of the kingsguard.

386
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,337
He can't be one now, can he?

387
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:45,276
But someday

388
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,007
he could be lord of a holdfast

389
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:50,379
or sit on the king's council.

390
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,295
Or he might raise castles

391
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,509
like Brandon the builder.

392
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,494
Can I be lord of a holdfast?

393
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:05,603
You will marry a high lord

394
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:07,155
and rule his castle.

395
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:10,238
And your sons shall be knights

396
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,660
and princes and lords.

397
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:19,518
That's not me.

398
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,724
Ser Alliser said
I'm to be your new watch partner.

399
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,289
I should warn you,

400
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,065
I don't see all that well.

401
00:25:57,217 --> 00:25:58,516
Come stand by the fire.

402
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:00,560
It's warmer.

403
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:03,438
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.
- You're not. You're freezing.

404
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,593
I don't like high places.

405
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,778
You can't fight.

406
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:22,696
You can't see.

407
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,508
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

408
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,881
What are you doing here, Sam?

409
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:38,060
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

410
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:41,471
"You're almost a man now," he said...

411
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,642
"but you're not worthy
of my land and title.

412
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,844
"Tomorrow,
you're going to take the black,

413
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:52,906
"forsake all claim to your inheritance
and start north.

414
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:55,482
"If you do not,"

415
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,415
he said...

416
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,203
"then we'll have a hunt

417
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:03,933
"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

418
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:06,666
"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

419
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:11,064
"Or so I'll tell your mother.

420
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:13,800
"Nothing would please me more."

421
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:22,482
Ser alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

422
00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:24,904
Yes, he is.

423
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,867
I'm not going to get
any better, you know?

424
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,361
You can't get any worse.

425
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:45,779
I hear you're reading a boring book.

426
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:50,024
Pycelle talks too much.

427
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,540
He never stops.

428
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,162
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

429
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,867
Not surprising.

430
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:59,462
Until recently,
he was only a squire...

431
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:01,360
Jon Arryn's squire.

432
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:06,220
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

433
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,864
Knighted for what?

434
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:12,775
- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.

435
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:14,849
Where is Ser Hugh?

436
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:18,062
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

437
00:28:18,187 --> 00:28:20,167
Do you see that boy there?

438
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,820
One of Varys's little birds.

439
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,978
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

440
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:28,281
Now look there.

441
00:28:29,212 --> 00:28:30,585
That one belongs to the queen.

442
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,797
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

443
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,587
Varys or the queen?

444
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:40,224
She's one of mine.

445
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,619
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

446
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,977
The wiser answer was no, my Lord.

447
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:55,064
Get a message
to this paragon of yours...

448
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:56,289
Discreetly.

449
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,663
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

450
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:02,585
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.

451
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,849
He lives in a large house
at the top of the street of Steel.

452
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:06,769
Why?

453
00:29:06,894 --> 00:29:08,456
I have my observers, as I said,

454
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:11,044
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

455
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:13,044
visit this armorer several times

456
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,898
in the weeks before his death.

457
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,592
Lord Baelish,
perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.

458
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:22,154
Distrusting me
was the wisest thing you've done

459
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,971
since you climbed off your horse.

460
00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:39,856
Ser Hugh?

461
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,950
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

462
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:47,010
I'm here on behalf
of Lord Eddard Stark,

463
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:48,902
the Hand of the king.

464
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,748
I'm the captain of his guard.

465
00:29:51,048 --> 00:29:52,875
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch your name, Ser...

466
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:55,117
No "ser." I'm not a knight.

467
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:56,045
I see.

468
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:58,756
Well, it just so happens that I am.

469
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:06,714
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

470
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,452
He's a knight, you see.

471
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,226
A knight.

472
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,345
They strut around
like roosters down here.

473
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,678
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

474
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,817
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

475
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,071
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

476
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,310
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

477
00:30:27,872 --> 00:30:30,796
I regret to say he did not
honor me with his patronage.

478
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,553
What did Lord Arryn want?

479
00:30:33,328 --> 00:30:35,163
He always came to see the boy.

480
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:37,069
I'd like to see him as well.

481
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,617
As you wish, my lord.

482
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,642
Gendry!

483
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:46,289
Here he is.

484
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:49,235
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

485
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,896
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

486
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,097
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

487
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,252
Boy, this is the king's Hand!

488
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:14,162
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.

489
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:17,426
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

490
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:21,665
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

491
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:24,050
He just asked me questions, my lord.

492
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,093
What kind of questions?

493
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,669
About my work at first,

494
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,313
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

495
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:38,838
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

496
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:40,608
Your mother?

497
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:42,985
Who she was, what she looked like.

498
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:45,321
What did you tell him?

499
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:48,601
She died when I was little.

500
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,364
She had yellow hair.

501
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:54,158
She'd sing to me sometimes.

502
00:31:58,434 --> 00:31:59,435
Look at me.

503
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,430
Get back to work, lad.

504
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:17,383
If the day ever comes when that boy'd
rather wield a sword than forge one,

505
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:19,981
you send him to me.

506
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:25,968
Find anything?

507
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:29,776
King Robert's bastard son.

508
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,063
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

509
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:45,323
Listen.

510
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,105
Do you hear them?

511
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:53,461
How many do you think
are in there with him?

512
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,542
Guess.

513
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:57,947
Three?

514
00:32:58,301 --> 00:32:59,103
Four.

515
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,100
He likes to do this
when I'm on duty...

516
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:05,651
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

517
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,576
- Forgive me...
- Why forgive you?

518
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,994
Have you wronged me?

519
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:18,706
We've met before, you know.

520
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,314
Have we?
Strange, I've forgotten.

521
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,297
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

522
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,662
That's where you got your scar?

523
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,939
One of the Greyjoys
nearly took my eye.

524
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:35,366
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

525
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,283
They stopped liking it at the end.

526
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,102
That was a proper battle.

527
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,440
D'you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

528
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,938
With his burning sword?

529
00:33:46,063 --> 00:33:48,135
I'll remember that
till the day I die.

530
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:51,656
I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

531
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,450
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

532
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,702
Theon?
He's a good lad.

533
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,953
I doubt it.

534
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:05,153
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!

535
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,417
Let me smell it. Come here.

536
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,407
Can I leave this with you?

537
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:15,054
- The message from Lord Stark.
- I don't serve Lord Stark.

538
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,788
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

539
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:43,277
- With Sam.
- Prince Porkchop.

540
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,276
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

541
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:46,402
Impossible!

542
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:48,838
That's enough.

543
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,641
Sam's no different
from the rest of us.

544
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:01,426
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

545
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,655
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

546
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,034
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

547
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,254
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

548
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:12,254
You are in love, Lord Snow.

549
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:17,658
You girls can do as you please.

550
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,047
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

551
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,539
i'm gonna slice me off
a side of bacon.

552
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,111
No one touches Sam.

553
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:04,858
What are you waiting for?

554
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,634
Attack him!

555
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,044
You get in there.

556
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:34,646
Hit me.

557
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,967
Go on, hit me!

558
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,243
I yield!

559
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,064
Yield yield.

560
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,483
I yield.

561
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,585
You think this is funny?

562
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:57,716
When you're out there

563
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,455
beyond the Wall
with the sun going down,

564
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:02,930
do you want a man at your back?

565
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,604
Or a sniveling boy?

566
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,570
You send this whore
to give me commands?

567
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:24,807
I should have sent you back her head!

568
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,652
- Forgive me. I did as you asked.
- Hush now. It's all right.

569
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,968
- Irri, take her and leave us.
- Yes, Khaleesi.

570
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:38,248
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

571
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,009
You do not command me.

572
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,679
I wasn't commanding you.
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

573
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,973
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

574
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:48,309
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

575
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,803
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

576
00:37:50,928 --> 00:37:52,730
This stinks of manure.

577
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:55,132
- All of it.
- Stop- stop it.

578
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:57,735
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

579
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,591
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

580
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:02,242
You've won no victories yet.

581
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:05,826
You do not talk back to me!

582
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,902
You are a horselord's slut.

583
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,165
And now you've woken the dragon...

584
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:20,096
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki!

585
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,595
I am the wife of the great Khal

586
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,896
and I carry his son inside me.

587
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:26,722
The next time

588
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:29,107
you raise a hand to me

589
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,415
will be the last time you have hands.

590
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:43,280
I know for a fact some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

591
00:38:44,161 --> 00:38:45,467
I wouldn't doubt it.

592
00:38:46,652 --> 00:38:48,729
Don't you think
it's a little bit unfair?

593
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:53,020
Making us take our vows while they sneak
off for a little sally on the side?

594
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,612
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

595
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:59,713
What, we can't defend the Wall
unless we're celibate?

596
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,699
It's absurd.

597
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:04,426
I didn't think
you'd be so upset about it.

598
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:06,703
Why not?

599
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,794
Because I'm fat?

600
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,365
But I like girls
just as much as you do.

601
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:16,188
They might not like me as much.

602
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:19,744
I've never...

603
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:21,610
been with one.

604
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:25,067
You've probably had hundreds.

605
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,610
As a matter of fact,

606
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,119
i'm the same as you.

607
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:37,585
I find that hard to believe.

608
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,291
I came very close once.

609
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:42,848
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

610
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:47,232
- You didn't know where to put it?
- I know where to put it.

611
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,392
Was she...

612
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,261
Old and ugly?

613
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:54,393
Young and gorgeous.

614
00:39:56,402 --> 00:39:57,938
A whore named Ros.

615
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:01,547
What color hair?

616
00:40:02,396 --> 00:40:04,667
- Red.
- I like red hair.

617
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:07,366
And her...

618
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,658
Her...

619
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:12,464
- You don't want to know.
- That good?

620
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:14,163
- Better.
- Oh no.

621
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:20,711
So why exactly did you not
make love to Ros with the perfect...

622
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:24,645
What's my name?

623
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:26,380
Jon Snow?

624
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,717
And why is my surname Snow?

625
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:32,278
Because...

626
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,892
You're a bastard from the north.

627
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,886
I never met my mother.

628
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,229
My father
wouldn't even tell me her name.

629
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,206
I don't know if she's living or dead.

630
00:40:47,418 --> 00:40:49,495
I don't know if she's a noblewoman

631
00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:51,325
or a fisherman's wife...

632
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:54,471
Or a whore.

633
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:58,784
So I sat there

634
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:02,583
in the brothel
as Ros took off her clothes.

635
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:05,824
But I couldn't do it.

636
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,348
Because all I could think was

637
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:11,631
what if I got her pregnant

638
00:41:12,534 --> 00:41:13,921
and she had a child,

639
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:16,942
another bastard named Snow?

640
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:23,936
It's not a good life for a child.

641
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:30,938
So...

642
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:33,951
You didn't know where to put it?

643
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:41,464
Enjoying yourselves?

644
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,608
You look cold, boys.

645
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:48,945
It is a bit nippy.

646
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,380
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

647
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,016
indoors.

648
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:55,597
It's still summer.

649
00:41:56,758 --> 00:41:58,921
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

650
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:03,101
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

651
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:05,566
I remember.

652
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,220
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

653
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,860
Were there days
when you just couldn't get warm,

654
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:12,948
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

655
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:16,839
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

656
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:21,290
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

657
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,981
during the last winter.

658
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:27,278
It was supposed
to be a two-week mission.

659
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,841
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

660
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:34,347
So we went out
to look for some of his men...

661
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:37,181
Capture them, gather some knowledge.

662
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,268
The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder
are hard men.

663
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:42,750
Harder than you'll ever be.

664
00:42:43,325 --> 00:42:45,546
They know their country
better than we do.

665
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,366
They knew
there was a storm coming in.

666
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,244
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

667
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,896
And we got caught in the open.

668
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,061
Wind so strong

669
00:42:58,572 --> 00:43:02,261
it yanked 100-foot trees straight
from the ground, roots and all.

670
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,583
If you took your gloves off
to find your cock to have a piss,

671
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,580
you lost a finger to the frost.

672
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,226
And all in darkness.

673
00:43:13,964 --> 00:43:15,135
You don't know cold.

674
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:17,835
Neither of you do.

675
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,538
The horses died first.

676
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,606
We didn't have enough to feed them,
to keep them warm.

677
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:32,585
Eating the horses was easy.

678
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:37,797
But later when we started to fall...

679
00:43:40,113 --> 00:43:41,344
That wasn't easy.

680
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:46,300
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

681
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:53,435
Soft, fat boys like you.

682
00:43:54,395 --> 00:43:56,490
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you

683
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:58,941
and still had bones
leftover for soup.

684
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,447
Soon we'll have new recruits

685
00:44:05,004 --> 00:44:07,459
and you lot will be passed
along to the Lord Commander

686
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:09,750
for assignment

687
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,990
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

688
00:44:15,075 --> 00:44:16,530
but you'd be fools to believe it.

689
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,680
You're boys still.

690
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,289
And come the winter you will die...

691
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:26,695
Like flies.

692
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:34,828
I hit him.

693
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:37,426
I hit the dragon.

694
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,886
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

695
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,598
Viserys is less
than the shadow of a snake.

696
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,487
He is still the true king.

697
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:45,812
The truth now:

698
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:50,208
do you want to see your brother
sitting on the iron throne?

699
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,830
But the common people
are waiting for him.

700
00:44:55,955 --> 00:44:59,948
Illyrio said they're sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

701
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:04,127
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

702
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:07,651
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

703
00:45:08,437 --> 00:45:10,537
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

704
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:15,770
Home.

705
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,455
I pray for home too.

706
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:26,420
My brother will never take back
the seven kingdoms.

707
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:31,563
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

708
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,437
He'll never take us home.

709
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,311
Lover's quarrel?

710
00:45:59,265 --> 00:46:00,592
I'm sorry. Do I...?

711
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,537
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He's known...

712
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:05,263
An old friend of the family.

713
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:08,470
I've known your mother
a long long time.

714
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:10,143
Why do they call you Littlefinger?

715
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:13,822
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

716
00:46:14,817 --> 00:46:17,485
When I was a child I was very small

717
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:20,188
and I come from a little spit
of land called The Fingers,

718
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:21,514
so you see,

719
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:24,324
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

720
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,632
I've been sitting here for days!

721
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,747
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

722
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,420
Gods, who is that?

723
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,552
Ser Gregor Clegane.

724
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:45,907
They call him the Mountain.

725
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,808
The Hound's older brother.

726
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,869
- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.

727
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:56,075
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

728
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,959
Look how far he's come.

729
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,610
Enough of the bloody pomp.
Have at it!

730
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,083
Not what you were expecting?

731
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,201
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

732
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,138
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

733
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,916
The Hound was just a pup,

734
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,518
six years old maybe.

735
00:48:42,195 --> 00:48:43,945
Gregor a few years older-

736
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,840
Already a big lad, already
getting a bit of a reputation.

737
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:52,868
Some lucky boys
just born with a talent for violence.

738
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,714
One evening...

739
00:48:56,073 --> 00:48:59,721
Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire...

740
00:49:00,414 --> 00:49:01,564
Gregor's toy,

741
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,157
a wooden knight.

742
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,349
Gregor never said a word,

743
00:49:07,863 --> 00:49:10,490
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

744
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,398
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

745
00:49:14,223 --> 00:49:15,475
Held him there

746
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:17,477
while the boy screamed,

747
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,513
while his face melted.

748
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:27,659
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

749
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,091
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

750
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:31,566
No, please don't.

751
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,585
If the Hound
so much as heard you mention it,

752
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,307
i'm afraid all the knights
in King's Landing

753
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,515
would not be able to save you.

754
00:49:52,162 --> 00:49:55,327
My lord, her grace the queen.

755
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,166
- Your grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

756
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:04,158
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

757
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,617
I thought we might put what
happened on the kingsroad behind us-

758
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:11,134
The ugliness with the wolves.

759
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,889
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

760
00:50:17,332 --> 00:50:20,864
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

761
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:23,576
How is Sansa?

762
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:26,217
She likes it here.

763
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:27,734
The only Stark who does.

764
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:31,596
Favors her mother,
not much of the north in her.

765
00:50:31,959 --> 00:50:33,281
What are you doing here?

766
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:35,992
I might ask the same of you.

767
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,883
What is it you hope to accomplish?

768
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:40,789
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

769
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,356
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

770
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:46,158
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

771
00:50:46,283 --> 00:50:48,828
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

772
00:50:48,953 --> 00:50:51,238
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

773
00:50:51,897 --> 00:50:54,214
If that's my job, then so be it.

774
00:50:56,148 --> 00:50:58,051
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

775
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,186
You take your orders
and you carry on.

776
00:51:02,702 --> 00:51:04,401
I suppose it makes sense.

777
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:07,732
Your older brother was trained to
lead and you were trained to follow.

778
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,446
I was also trained to kill my enemies,
your grace.

779
00:51:14,335 --> 00:51:15,336
As was I.

780
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,094
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

781
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,213
And to you.

782
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:40,763
Boy!
Bread, meat and beer, quickly.

783
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:42,934
Good idea, grandfather.
I'm starving.

784
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,604
- A song while we wait or?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.

785
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:50,225
Grandfather, may be your last chance
if you're heading north.

786
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,403
The only music the northerners
know is the howling of wolves!

787
00:51:56,886 --> 00:52:00,118
I'm sorry, my lord, we're full up.
Every room.

788
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,069
My men can sleep in the stable.

789
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,920
As for myself,
I don't require a large room.

790
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:07,471
Truly, my lord, we have nothing.

791
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:09,853
Is there nothing I can do...

792
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:12,149
to remedy this?

793
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:14,424
You can have my room.

794
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,800
There's a clever man.

795
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:20,580
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

796
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:24,934
My Lord of Lannister!
Might I entertain you while you eat?

797
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,812
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

798
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,620
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

799
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,193
Lady Stark!

800
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,695
What an unexpected pleasure.

801
00:52:36,993 --> 00:52:39,422
I was sorry
to have missed you at Winterfell.

802
00:52:49,189 --> 00:52:51,281
I was still Catelyn Tully

803
00:52:51,406 --> 00:52:53,306
the last time I stayed here.

804
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,009
You, Ser...

805
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,705
is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

806
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,335
It is, my lady.

807
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,728
Is Lady Whent a true
and honest friend to my father...

808
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:11,955
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

809
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:13,691
She is.

810
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:18,918
The Red Stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

811
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:21,592
My father counts Jonas Bracken

812
00:53:21,717 --> 00:53:24,744
amongst his oldest
and most loyal bannermen.

813
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,621
Our lord is honored by his trust.

814
00:53:27,878 --> 00:53:31,020
I envy your father
all his fine friends...

815
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,087
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

816
00:53:35,698 --> 00:53:37,507
I know your sigil as well...

817
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,176
The twin towers of Frey.

818
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:43,680
How fares your lord, Ser?

819
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,723
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

820
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:50,179
He has asked your father for the honor
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

821
00:53:50,304 --> 00:53:52,230
He plans to take another wife.

822
00:53:59,419 --> 00:54:00,864
This man...

823
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:02,949
came into my house as a guest

824
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:07,871
and there conspired to murder my son,

825
00:54:08,964 --> 00:54:10,180
a boy of 10.

826
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,254
In the name of king Robert
and the good lords you serve,

827
00:54:16,938 --> 00:54:19,090
I call upon you to seize him

828
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:22,719
and help me return him to Winterfell

829
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,596
to await the king's justice.

830
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,800
