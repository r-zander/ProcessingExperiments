1
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:16,068
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:18,937
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the small council.

3
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:21,057
The honor of your
presence is requested.

4
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:25,813
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,524
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, My Lord.

6
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:32,828
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

7
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:10,606
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

8
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,024
About time we had some
stern northern leadership.

9
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,823
I see you're protecting the throne.

10
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:20,147
Sturdy old thing.

11
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:23,049
How many kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?

12
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:24,451
What's the line?

13
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:27,541
The King shits and the Hand wipes.

14
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,397
Very handsome armor.

15
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:33,534
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

16
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:37,175
People have been swinging at me for
years, but they always seem to miss.

17
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,844
You've chosen
your opponents wisely then.

18
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,872
I have a knack for it.

19
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:49,672
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.

20
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,749
I was standing right here
when it happened.

21
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,572
He was very brave, your brother.
Your father too.

22
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:01,867
They didn't deserve to die like that.

23
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,646
Nobody deserves to die like that.

24
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:06,705
But you just stood there and watched.

25
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,666
500 men just stood there and watched.

26
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,354
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

27
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,880
You think anyone said a
word, lifted a finger?

28
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,511
No, Lord Stark.

29
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,960
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

30
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:26,201
Except for the screams, of course,

31
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,071
and the Mad King laughing.

32
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,994
And later...

33
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,404
When I watched the Mad King die,

34
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,838
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

35
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:40,863
It felt like justice.

36
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:46,873
Is that what you tell yourself
at night?

37
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:49,728
You're a servant of justice?

38
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,461
That you were avenging
my father when you

39
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:55,064
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?

40
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:56,593
Tell me...

41
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,226
If I'd stabbed the Mad King
in the belly instead of the back,

42
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,677
would you admire me more?

43
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,699
You served him well

44
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:07,278
when serving was safe.

45
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,194
Lord Stark.

46
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:26,308
Lord Varys.

47
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:30,200
I was grievously sorry to hear
of your troubles on the Kingsroad.

48
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:33,667
We are all praying
for prince Joffrey's full recovery.

49
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,920
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

50
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,382
Renly!

51
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:43,404
- You're looking well.
- And you look tired from the road.

52
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,637
I told them this meeting
could wait another day, but...

53
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,306
But we have a kingdom to look after.

54
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:51,734
I've hoped to meet you for some time,
Lord Stark.

55
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:55,330
- No doubt has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

56
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:58,648
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

57
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:01,844
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem

58
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,613
from navel to collarbone.

59
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,824
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

60
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,118
It wasn't the man
that I chose, My Lord.

61
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,834
It was Catelyn Tully.

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,498
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

63
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,167
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

64
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,423
Grand Maester.

65
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,173
How many years has it been?

66
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,675
- You were a young man.
- And you served another King.

67
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,391
How forgetful of me.

68
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,059
This belongs to you, now.

69
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,480
Should we begin?

70
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,859
Without the King?

71
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,819
Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid
the same cannot be said for my brother.

72
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,156
His Grace has many cares.

73
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,263
He entrusts some small matters to us

74
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:51,122
that we might lighten the load.

75
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,788
We are the lords
of small matters here.

76
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,838
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

77
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,442
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

78
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,969
- Mmm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

79
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,721
20,000 to the runner-up,

80
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:12,886
20,000 to the winning archer.

81
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,227
Can the treasury bear such expense?

82
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,046
I'll have to borrow it. The
Lannisters will accommodate.

83
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,556
We already owe Lord Tywin
3 million gold. What's another 80,000?

84
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,403
- The Crown is three million in debt?
- The Crown is six million in debt.

85
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:29,157
- How could you let this happen?
- The Master of Coin finds the money.

86
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,618
The King and the Hand spend it.

87
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,148
I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

88
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,098
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

89
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:42,174
but I fear His Grace
doesn't always listen.

90
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:44,464
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

91
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:47,408
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

92
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:49,803
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.

93
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:52,639
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

94
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,267
There will be no plans
until I speak to Robert.

95
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,210
Forgive me, my Lords.

96
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:04,625
I had a long ride.

97
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,378
You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark,
we serve at your pleasure.

98
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,497
Please, it's nearly healed.

99
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,335
It's ugly.

100
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,672
A King should have scars
you fought off a direwolf.

101
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,259
- You're a warrior like your father.
- I'm not like him.

102
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,137
I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

103
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,889
And the two Stark girls saw it,
both of them.

104
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,993
That's not true.
You killed the beast.

105
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:41,396
You only spared the girl because of the
love your father bears her father.

106
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:44,366
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,

107
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,868
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.

108
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,363
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

109
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,767
Do I have to marry her?

110
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:58,538
Yes.

111
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,125
She's very beautiful and young.

112
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:05,526
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

113
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:08,423
and when the time comes, to make
little princes and princesses.

114
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:15,108
And if you'd rather fuck painted
whores, you'll fuck painted whores.

115
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,641
And if you'd rather lie
with noble virgins, so be it.

116
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,810
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

117
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,858
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

118
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,534
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

119
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:34,638
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

120
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:37,439
We allow the northerners
too much power.

121
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:39,663
They consider themselves our equals.

122
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,093
How would you handle them?

123
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,112
I'd double their taxes

124
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:47,254
and command them to supply
10,000 men to the royal army.

125
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:48,664
A royal army?

126
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,627
Why should every lord
command his own men?

127
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,822
It's primitive,
no better than the hill tribes.

128
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:56,090
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

129
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:57,727
trained by experienced soldiers...

130
00:09:57,852 --> 00:09:59,391
Instead of a mob of peasants

131
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,393
who've never held pikes
in their lives.

132
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:05,087
- And if the northerners rebel?
- I'd crush them.

133
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,646
Seize Winterfell and install someone

134
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,901
loyal to the realm
as Warden of the North.

135
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,409
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

136
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:15,156
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

137
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,778
For me.
I'm their King.

138
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:19,647
But you've just
invaded their homeland,

139
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:21,382
asked them to kill their brothers.

140
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:22,450
I'm not asking.

141
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,486
The North cannot be held...
not by an outsider.

142
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:27,590
It's too big and too wild.

143
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:31,196
When the winter comes,
the Seven couldn't save you and your army.

144
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,281
A good King knows
when to save his strength...

145
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:38,346
And when to destroy his enemies.

146
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,133
So you agree...

147
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:43,435
The Starks are enemies?

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,812
Everyone who isn't us

149
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,654
is an enemy.

150
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,195
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

151
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,198
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

152
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,284
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

153
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:02,495
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

154
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,913
The Hound killed your friend.

155
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,389
The Hound does
whatever the prince tells him to do.

156
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:08,051
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar.

157
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,211
And if you told the truth,
Mycah would be alive.

158
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,629
Enough!

159
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:15,920
What's happening here?

160
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,893
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

161
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,307
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.

162
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,274
That's for you, love.

163
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,592
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

164
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:48,500
Don't you like it?

165
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:52,128
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

166
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:56,539
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

167
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,155
It's all right.

168
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:00,634
Go on.

169
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,648
War was easier than daughters.

170
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:18,754
Go away!

171
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:20,892
Arya, open the door.

172
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,476
May I come in?

173
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,787
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

174
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,783
Give it to me.

175
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,762
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

176
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,953
Where did you get this?

177
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:03,121
This is no toy.

178
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,852
- Ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

179
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,790
And I don't want to be a lady.

180
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:12,888
Come here.

181
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,635
Now what do you want with this?

182
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,436
It's called Needle.

183
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,525
A blade with a name.

184
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,124
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

185
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:30,271
Your sister?

186
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,775
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

187
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,356
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

188
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,234
That's the essence of it.

189
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:43,041
I was trying to learn.

190
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,702
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

191
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,164
I asked him.

192
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,251
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.

193
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,630
You didn't kill the butcher's boy.

194
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:01,803
I hate them!

195
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,349
I hate all of them.

196
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,779
The Hound, the Queen and the King

197
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,378
and Joffrey and Sansa.

198
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,974
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...

199
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:13,253
And asked to call the prince a liar.

200
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,322
So was I!
He is a liar.

201
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,548
Darling, listen to me.

202
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,570
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.

203
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,887
She cannot betray him.

204
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:27,966
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

205
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,955
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

206
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,861
Look at me.

207
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:41,548
You're a Stark of Winterfell.

208
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,409
You know our words.

209
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:47,321
Winter is coming.

210
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:50,229
You were born in the long summer.

211
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:52,602
You've never known anything else.

212
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,436
But now winter is truly coming.

213
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,730
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

214
00:14:58,683 --> 00:14:59,951
look after one another.

215
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,234
Sansa is your sister.

216
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,063
I don't hate her.

217
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:07,865
Not really.

218
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:11,244
I don't want to frighten you,

219
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,121
but I won't lie to you either.

220
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,548
We've come to a dangerous place.

221
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:19,112
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

222
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,332
All right?

223
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,135
Go on.

224
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,558
It's yours.

225
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:30,471
I can keep it?

226
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,790
Try not to stab your sister with it.

227
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,441
If you're going to own a sword,

228
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,682
you'd better know how to use it.

229
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,414
Don't listen to it.

230
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,076
Crows are all liars.

231
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,825
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

232
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:07,795
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

233
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:11,190
I could tell you
about Ser Duncan the Tall.

234
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:13,248
Those were always your favorites.

235
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,884
Those weren't my favorites.

236
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:18,019
My favorites were the scary ones.

237
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:21,612
Oh, my sweet summer child.

238
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:23,872
What do you know about fear?

239
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,052
Fear is for the winter,

240
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:30,055
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

241
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,200
Fear is for the long night,

242
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,072
when the sun hides for years

243
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:38,332
and children are born
and live and die

244
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,112
all in darkness.

245
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,771
That is the time for fear,
my little Lord,

246
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,975
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

247
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,614
Thousands of years ago
there came a night

248
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:54,100
that lasted a generation.

249
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,665
Kings froze to death
in their castles,

250
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,284
same as the shepherds in their huts.

251
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,832
And women smothered their babies

252
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:04,001
rather than see them starve,

253
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:08,163
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

254
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,739
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

255
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,001
In that darkness,

256
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,664
the White Walkers
came for the first time.

257
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,746
They swept through cities
and kingdoms,

258
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,947
riding their dead horses,

259
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:28,881
hunting with their packs
of pale spiders big as hounds...

260
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,263
What are you telling him now?

261
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,724
Only what the little lord
wants to hear.

262
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,252
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

263
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,667
One time she told me

264
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,700
the sky is blue because we live

265
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,536
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

266
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,844
Maybe we do.

267
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,590
How do you feel?

268
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:10,840
You still don't remember anything?

269
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:17,030
I've seen you climb a thousand times.

270
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,965
In the wind, in the rain...

271
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:21,893
A thousand times.
You never fall.

272
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,251
I did though.

273
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,523
It's true, isn't it...

274
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:31,903
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?

275
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,537
I'd rather be dead.

276
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:44,040
Don't ever say that.

277
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,951
I'd rather be dead.

278
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:00,376
Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.

279
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,346
But still too many.

280
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:05,144
It's nine years
since I've set foot in the capital.

281
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:08,627
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came either.

282
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,277
My Lady.

283
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,784
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

284
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,868
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

285
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,021
We've been instructed to escort you.

286
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:23,321
Instructed?

287
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,592
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

288
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,442
Follow me, Lady Stark.

289
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,597
Cat!

290
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,935
Go on.
Go upstairs.

291
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,465
You little worm!

292
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,109
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

293
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,826
I meant no disrespect

294
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,099
to you of all people.

295
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,788
How dare you bring me here!

296
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:07,290
Have you lost your mind?

297
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,417
No one will look here.
Like you wanted?

298
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:11,378
I'm truly sorry...

299
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,327
about the locale.

300
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,841
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

301
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,927
A dear friend told me.

302
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,721
Lady Stark.

303
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:23,417
Lord Varys.

304
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:27,561
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

305
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,979
Your poor hands.

306
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,191
How did you know I was coming?

307
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,743
Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.

308
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,865
Did you bring the dagger
with you, by any chance?

309
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:42,951
My little birds are everywhere.

310
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,060
Even in the north.

311
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,582
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

312
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,150
Valyrian steel.

313
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,550
Do you know whose dagger this is?

314
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,001
I must admit I do not.

315
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,324
Well well, this is an historic day.

316
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,603
Something you don't know

317
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:11,938
that I do.

318
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,929
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

319
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:20,530
It's mine.

320
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,150
Yours?

321
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,409
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

322
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:30,997
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,
as any sane man would.

323
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:33,997
When the Knight of the Flowers
unseated him,

324
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:37,380
- I lost this dagger.
- To whom?

325
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,467
Tyrion Lannister.

326
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,060
The Imp.

327
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,513
Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

328
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:53,302
If that were a real sword,
you'd be dead.

329
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:57,192
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle

330
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,486
spitting down on the likes of you.

331
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:01,325
Pyp.

332
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:05,463
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

333
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:14,542
Next!

334
00:22:25,838 --> 00:22:26,763
Next!

335
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,705
Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

336
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,492
Go clean yourselves up.

337
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:50,328
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

338
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,230
A charming man.

339
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,252
I don't need him to be charming.

340
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:57,085
I need him to turn this bunch

341
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,046
of thieves and runaways
into men of the Night's Watch.

342
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:03,274
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

343
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:04,740
Slowly.

344
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:08,918
A raven came

345
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:10,974
for Ned Stark's son.

346
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,104
Good news or bad?

347
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,407
Both.

348
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:21,327
Lord Stark.

349
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,239
I meant to give you this earlier.

350
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:30,225
So forgetful these days.

351
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:35,112
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

352
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:47,332
Good news?

353
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,781
Perhaps you'd like to
share it with your wife?

354
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,312
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

355
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,699
Yes, I'm looking at you.

356
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,881
I thought
that she'd be safest in here.

357
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,469
One of several
such establishments I own.

358
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,669
You're a funny man.

359
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,631
A very funny man.

360
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,030
The Starks...

361
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:39,050
Quick tempers, slow minds.

362
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,447
You broke my nose, bastard!

363
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,070
It's an improvement.

364
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:02,531
If we threw you over the Wall,
wonder how long it'd take you to hit.

365
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,021
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

366
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:11,458
What're you looking at, Half Man?

367
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:13,763
I'm looking at you.

368
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:18,986
You've got an interesting face.

369
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,315
Very distinctive faces.
All of you.

370
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:27,652
What do you care about our faces?

371
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,075
It's just
I think they would look marvelous

372
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,533
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

373
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,627
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.

374
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:40,918
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

375
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:50,508
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

376
00:25:51,706 --> 00:25:52,844
No one but you.

377
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:55,172
My father knew

378
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:57,599
and left me to rot here all the same.

379
00:25:58,168 --> 00:25:59,851
Grenn's father left him too...

380
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,060
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.

381
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:07,108
Pyp was caught
stealing a wheel of cheese.

382
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,637
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

383
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,172
He was given a choice:
his right hand or the Wall.

384
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:16,951
I've been asking the Lord
Commander about them.

385
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,328
Fascinating stories.

386
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,663
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

387
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,083
Lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like Ser Rodrik.

388
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,004
I don't imagine any of them
ever held a real sword before here.

389
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:36,772
Your brother Bran.

390
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,015
He's woken up.

391
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,644
The mere suggestion
that the Queen's brother

392
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,916
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.

393
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,191
We have proof.
We have the blade.

394
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,278
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

395
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:52,804
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

396
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:54,197
thanks to your boy's wolf.

397
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,576
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

398
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:00,870
He's like a little brother to me.

399
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:03,623
He would never betray my trust.

400
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,960
I'll try to keep you alive,
for her sake.

401
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:08,002
A fool's task, admittedly,

402
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,644
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

403
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:12,409
I won't forget this.

404
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,988
You're a true friend.

405
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,885
Don't tell anyone.

406
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,778
I have a reputation to maintain.

407
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:24,978
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

408
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,429
He's a child... 10 years old.

409
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:29,524
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

410
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,831
You're a bit late
to start complaining about it now.

411
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,165
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.

412
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,294
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.

413
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,991
Then what are you raving about?

414
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,758
What if it comes back to him?

415
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:42,900
- If he tells his father what he saw...
- We'll say he was lying.

416
00:27:43,025 --> 00:27:45,540
We'll say he was dreaming.
We'll say whatever we like.

417
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:47,749
I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.

418
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,960
And my husband?

419
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,019
I'll go to war with him if I have to.

420
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:54,034
They can write a ballad about us:

421
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,508
"The War for Cersei's Cunt."

422
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,065
- Let me go.
- Never.

423
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:04,735
Let me go.

424
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:07,214
The boy won't talk.

425
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,439
And if he does, I'll kill him.

426
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:13,541
Him, Ned Stark, the King...
the whole bloody lot of them,

427
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,410
until you and I are the only people

428
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:18,175
left in this world.

429
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,244
I wish I could see the girls.

430
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,360
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

431
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,758
Until we know who our enemies are...

432
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,898
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

433
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:40,552
In my bones, I know it.

434
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,620
Littlefinger's right.

435
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,905
I can't do anything without proof.

436
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,700
And if you find the proof?

437
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,308
Then I bring it to Robert...

438
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:54,572
And hope
he's still the man I once knew.

439
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,252
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

440
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:01,722
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

441
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:02,848
My temper?

442
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:04,698
Gods be good,

443
00:29:04,823 --> 00:29:07,117
you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

444
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,649
He still loves you.

445
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,371
Does he?

446
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,109
Off with you.

447
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,457
It's been a long time.

448
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:15,148
But I still remember every face.

449
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,626
You remember your first?

450
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:22,870
Of course, Your Grace.

451
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:24,849
Who was it?

452
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,201
A Tyroshi.

453
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:29,349
Never learned the name.

454
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:32,457
How'd you do it?

455
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,480
Lance through the heart.

456
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,294
Quick one.

457
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,101
Lucky for you.

458
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,926
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

459
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:47,176
My horse took an arrow

460
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:49,974
so I was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

461
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,392
He came running at me,

462
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:56,670
this dumb high-born lad,

463
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,150
thinking he could end the rebellion
with the single swing of his sword.

464
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:04,684
I knocked him down with the hammer.

465
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,241
Gods, I was strong then.

466
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:09,840
Caved in his breastplate.

467
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,414
Probably shattered every rib he had.

468
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,126
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

469
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:21,194
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait!

470
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:22,806
"Wait."

471
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:32,148
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

472
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,821
They don't put that part
in the songs.

473
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,025
Stupid boy.

474
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:46,172
Now the Tarlys bend the knee

475
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:48,040
like everyone else.

476
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,525
He could have lingered

477
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,228
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys

478
00:31:53,353 --> 00:31:54,354
and today

479
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:57,162
his wife would
be making him miserable,

480
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,869
his sons would be ingrates,

481
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,815
and he'd be waking
three times in the night

482
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,882
to piss into a bowl. Wine!

483
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:10,306
Lancel.

484
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,573
Gods, what a stupid name.

485
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,907
Lancel Lannister.

486
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,731
Who named you?

487
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,316
Some halfwit with a stutter?

488
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:26,970
What are you doing?

489
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:30,032
It's empty, Your Grace.

490
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,534
What do you mean it's empty?

491
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,393
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?

492
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,666
So get more.

493
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,180
Tell your cousin to get in here.

494
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,132
Kingslayer!

495
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:48,092
Get in here.

496
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,133
Surrounded by Lannisters.

497
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:02,938
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

498
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:06,365
and their smug, satisfied faces.

499
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,168
It must wound your pride, huh?

500
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:12,116
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

501
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,413
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

502
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,137
Forced to mind the door

503
00:33:20,262 --> 00:33:23,085
while your King
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

504
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,254
So come on.

505
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,913
We're telling war stories.

506
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:34,335
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

507
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:38,565
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.

508
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:40,766
I was there that day.

509
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:44,370
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

510
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:47,360
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

511
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:49,137
Best move I ever saw.

512
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,004
A good fighter, Toyne,

513
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:53,991
but he lacked stamina.

514
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,118
Your outlaw...

515
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,746
Any last words?

516
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,331
I cut his head off, so no.

517
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,209
What about Aerys Targaryen?

518
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:08,462
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

519
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:10,126
I never asked.

520
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:13,321
Did he call you a traitor?

521
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,264
Did he plead for a reprieve?

522
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,172
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

523
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,512
"Burn them all."

524
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:31,549
If that's all, Your Grace...

525
00:35:04,342 --> 00:35:06,817
Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?

526
00:35:06,942 --> 00:35:08,910
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

527
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:11,197
Most of their slaves
were given to them as gifts.

528
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:12,658
From whom?

529
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:14,979
If you rule a city
and you see the horde approaching,

530
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:16,435
you have two choices:

531
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,428
Pay tribute or fight.

532
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,077
An easy choice for most.

533
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,841
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

534
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:27,209
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

535
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:30,379
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

536
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,549
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

537
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,874
and need the practice.

538
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,276
Tell them all to stop.

539
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,852
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

540
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:48,709
Until I command them otherwise.

541
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:51,692
You're learning to talk like a Queen.

542
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,413
Not a Queen.

543
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:55,613
A Khaleesi.

544
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:34,438
You dare!

545
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:36,529
You give commands to me?

546
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:38,122
To me?

547
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:43,244
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

548
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,164
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts.

549
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,541
Do you hear me?

550
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:57,174
Rakharo ask if you want him dead,
Khaleesi.

551
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:04,390
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

552
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,077
Please please, don't hurt him.

553
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:14,900
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

554
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,208
Kill these Dothraki dogs!

555
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:39,261
I am your King!

556
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,303
Shall we return to the Khalasar?

557
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,704
You walk.

558
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:40,650
I wanted to be here

559
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:43,724
when you saw it for the first time.

560
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:52,939
I'm leaving this morning.

561
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,787
You're leaving?

562
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:57,607
I'm the First Ranger.

563
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,751
My job is out there.

564
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:03,075
There have been disturbing reports.

565
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:05,769
- What kind of reports?
- The kind I don't want to believe.

566
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,634
I'm ready.

567
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,127
I won't let you down.

568
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,429
You're not going.

569
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:16,934
You're no ranger, Jon.

570
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,671
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

571
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:25,968
Here...

572
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:28,544
A man gets what he earns,

573
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:30,827
when he earns it.

574
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,176
We'll speak when I return.

575
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,619
- A bear's balls.
- You're joking?

576
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:59,831
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart

577
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:02,169
all fried in his own fat.

578
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,883
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

579
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:08,318
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

580
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:11,723
And how do a bear's balls taste?

581
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,260
A bit chewy.

582
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,745
And what about you, My Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

583
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,957
Do Dornish girls count?

584
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,205
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,

585
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,528
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves

586
00:42:31,653 --> 00:42:33,427
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?

587
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:37,738
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

588
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:41,483
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

589
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:44,229
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

590
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,870
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

591
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,352
The Night's Watch
is a joke to you, is it?

592
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:53,822
Is that what we are, Lannister?

593
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,700
An army of jesters in black?

594
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:59,369
You don't have enough men
to be an army

595
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,901
and aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

596
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:05,453
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

597
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,376
when you're back in King's Landing.

598
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,944
But something to think about

599
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:11,080
while you're drinking
your wine down there,

600
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:13,049
enjoying your brothels...

601
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,387
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

602
00:43:18,424 --> 00:43:20,593
Might be a wilding's axe
that gets them,

603
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:22,512
might be sickness,

604
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,639
might just be the cold.

605
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:28,384
They die in pain.

606
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:30,108
And they do it

607
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:34,446
so plump little lords like you
can enjoy their summer afternoons

608
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,033
in peace and comfort.

609
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:40,035
Do you think I'm plump?

610
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,393
Listen, Benjen...
May I call you Benjen?

611
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:47,668
Call me what you like.

612
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,045
I'm not sure
what I've done to offend you.

613
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,262
I have great admiration
for the Night's Watch.

614
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:54,308
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

615
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,344
You know, my brother once told me

616
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:59,458
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"

617
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:00,824
really counts.

618
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:03,297
But...

619
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:07,690
I don't believe that giants
and ghouls and White Walkers

620
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,147
are lurking beyond the Wall.

621
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:13,068
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

622
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,153
is that when the Wall went up,

623
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,489
our ancestors happened
to live on the right side of it.

624
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:19,984
You're right.

625
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:24,121
The wildlings
are no different from us.

626
00:44:25,282 --> 00:44:27,040
A little rougher maybe.

627
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:29,472
But they're made of meat and bone.

628
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,296
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

629
00:44:33,328 --> 00:44:36,316
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

630
00:44:37,728 --> 00:44:41,772
You've never been north of the Wall,
so don't tell me what's out there.

631
00:44:45,846 --> 00:44:47,244
Are you going below?

632
00:44:49,138 --> 00:44:50,925
Keep well, keep warm.

633
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,199
- Enjoy the capital, brother.
- I always do.

634
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:05,704
I think he's starting to like me.

635
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,815
"Going below"?

636
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:15,324
Into the tunnel
and out the other side.

637
00:45:16,438 --> 00:45:19,051
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

638
00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:23,847
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

639
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,630
Day after tomorrow.

640
00:45:27,482 --> 00:45:30,422
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

641
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:32,439
Let's share the road.

642
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,727
I could use some decent company.

643
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:39,799
I travel a bit
on the grubby side, My Lord.

644
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,837
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

645
00:45:43,962 --> 00:45:45,828
No one turns away a Lannister.

646
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:08,326
What are you doing?

647
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:10,749
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?

648
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,781
You change, Khaleesi.

649
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,779
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade

650
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:29,843
is a good thing, easier to handle.

651
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,791
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.

652
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,822
But a man in full plate...

653
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:40,967
the arakh won't get
through the steel.

654
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:44,219
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

655
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,050
Designed for piercing plate.

656
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:54,250
- Armor.
- Armor.

657
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,434
Armor make a man...

658
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:59,077
- Vroz?
- Slow.

659
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,319
- Slow.
- It's true,

660
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,528
but it also keeps a man alive.

661
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:24,306
He still is.

662
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,315
A man of great honor

663
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,431
and I betrayed him.

664
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,124
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

665
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,546
The Khaleesi have baby inside her.

666
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:06,573
It is true.
She does not bleed for two moons.

667
00:48:07,296 --> 00:48:08,931
Her belly start to swell.

668
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,374
She does not want to eat horse.

669
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,980
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

670
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:26,586
I need to ride to Qohor.

671
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:33,912
We ride for Vaes Dothrak.

672
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,021
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

673
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:38,750
The horde's easy to find.

674
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,998
Don't stand so still.

675
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:54,645
It's harder to hit a moving target.

676
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:01,731
Except for you. You move too much.

677
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,276
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

678
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:12,313
How many winters have
you seen, Lord Tyrion?

679
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:15,245
Eight... no, nine.

680
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,222
All of them brief?

681
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,084
They say the winter of my birth was
three years long, Maester Aemon.

682
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,013
This summer has lasted nine.

683
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,610
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

684
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,969
The Starks are always
right eventually:

685
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:33,731
Winter is coming.

686
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:36,566
This one will be long

687
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:39,825
and dark things will come with it.

688
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:42,442
We've been capturing wildlings,

689
00:49:42,692 --> 00:49:45,475
more every month.
They're fleeing south.

690
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:47,075
The ones who flee...

691
00:49:47,924 --> 00:49:50,224
say they've seen the White Walkers.

692
00:49:50,642 --> 00:49:53,366
Yes, and the fishermen of
Lannisport say they see mermaids.

693
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,234
One of our own rangers swore he
saw them kill his companions.

694
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:59,083
He swore it right up to the moment

695
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,999
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

696
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:04,085
The Night's Watch is the only thing

697
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,679
standing between the realm

698
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:08,048
and what lies beyond.

699
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:09,935
And it has has become an army

700
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:12,719
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.

701
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:16,884
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

702
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:20,226
We can't man the other
castles on the Wall.

703
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:23,438
We can't properly
patrol the wilderness.

704
00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:26,952
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

705
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,200
Your sister

706
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,356
sits by the side the King.

707
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:35,575
Tell her we need help.

708
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,911
When winter does come,

709
00:50:38,657 --> 00:50:41,314
gods help us all if we're not ready.

710
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:50,682
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.

711
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:54,373
It's either me or this cold.

712
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:56,656
And it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

713
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,470
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way South?

714
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,910
I expect I will.

715
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,933
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds

716
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:04,958
between here and King's Landing.

717
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,021
If you see my brother Bran,

718
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:09,878
tell him I miss him.

719
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,506
- Tell him I'd visit if I could.
- Of course.

720
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,133
He'll never walk again.

721
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,096
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

722
00:52:21,623 --> 00:52:22,599
Take care, Snow.

723
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,587
Farewell, My Lord.

724
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,193
You are late, boy.

725
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,320
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

726
00:52:43,714 --> 00:52:45,324
Who are you?

727
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:49,542
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

728
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,298
Tomorrow you will catch it.

729
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:57,019
Now pick it up.

730
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:01,674
That is not the way, boy.

731
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:05,974
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.

732
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:10,313
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

733
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,065
to make you strong.

734
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:13,858
Just so.

735
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,074
One hand is all that is needed.

736
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,990
Now you are standing all wrong.

737
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,642
Turn your body sideface.

738
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:26,862
So.

739
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:29,916
You are skinny. That is good.

740
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,085
The target is smaller.

741
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:35,046
Now the grip... Let me see.

742
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,699
The grip must be delicate.

743
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,451
What if I drop it?

744
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:46,057
The steel must be part of your arm.

745
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,383
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

746
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,762
Nine years Syrio Forel was first
sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

747
00:53:53,377 --> 00:53:55,817
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

748
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:57,652
I'm a girl.

749
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:58,961
Boy, girl...

750
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,079
You are a sword,

751
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,796
that is all.

752
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:06,343
That is the grip.

753
00:54:07,063 --> 00:54:08,830
You are not holding a battle-axe.

754
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,582
- You are holding...
- A needle.

755
00:54:14,607 --> 00:54:16,231
Just so.

756
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,298
Now we will begin the dance.

757
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:20,383
Remember, child,

758
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:23,845
this is not the dance of the
Westeros we are learning...

759
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,014
The knight's dance,

760
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,433
hacking and hammering.

761
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:31,602
This is the Bravo's dance...

762
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:34,839
The water dance.

763
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:36,561
It is swift

764
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,361
and sudden.

765
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:43,181
All men are made of water,

766
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:44,949
do you know this?

767
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:47,285
If you pierce them,

768
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:51,304
the water leaks out and they die.

769
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:56,252
Now you will try to strike me.

770
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:13,775
Up!

771
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,999
Dead.

772
00:55:36,984 --> 00:55:37,835
Dead.

773
00:55:42,356 --> 00:55:43,657
Very dead.

774
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,219
Come.

775
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,949
Again, faster.
