2
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:24,394
Does Ser Hugh have any family
in the capital?

3
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,919
I stood vigil for him myself
last night.

4
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:32,337
He had no one else.

5
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,865
He'd never worn this armor before.

6
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:39,897
Bad luck for him...
going against the Mountain.

7
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,697
Who determines the draw?

8
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,636
All the knights draw straws,
Lord Stark.

9
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,247
But who holds the straws?

10
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,641
You've done good work, sisters.

11
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,176
Life is strange.

12
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,824
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

13
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:07,348
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

14
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:10,632
As is my wife. I don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

15
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:15,403
You're too modest. I've seen you
cut down a dozen great knights.

16
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,009
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

17
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,368
I never knew the man to be
wrong about matters of combat.

18
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,543
He was a fine man, your father.

19
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,725
What the Mad King did to him
was a terrible crime.

20
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,050
And that lad...

21
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:34,222
He was a squire until a few months ago.
How could he afford a new suit of armor?

22
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:37,204
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

23
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:42,815
- I hear the King wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

24
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,433
Robert tends to do what he wants.

25
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,944
If the King got what he wanted
all the time,

26
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,719
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

27
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,368
It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

28
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:02,547
Your mother was a dumb whore
with a fat ass. Did you know that?

29
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,124
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

30
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,104
He can't even put a man's
armor on him properly.

31
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,583
- You're too fat for your armor.
- Fat?

32
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:16,966
Fat, is it?

33
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,009
Is that how you speak to your King?

34
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,020
That was funny, is it?

35
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,067
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

36
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,443
You don't like the Hand's joke?

37
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,031
- You're torturing the poor boy.
- You heard the Hand.

38
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,618
The King's too fat for his armor.
Go find the breastplate stretcher!

39
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,731
Now!

40
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:52,418
- "The breastplate stretcher"?
- How long before he figures it out?

41
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:55,670
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

42
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,607
But you watch me out there...
I still know how to point a lance.

43
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,469
You have no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

44
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,980
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

45
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,225
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

46
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:10,228
- And the last man in his saddle
- Will be you.

47
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,272
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

48
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,415
Are you telling me those cowards
would let me win?

49
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,828
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

50
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,205
Drink. Your King commands it.

51
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,293
Gods,

52
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:36,963
too fat for my armor.

53
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:41,255
Your squire... A Lannister boy?

54
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,805
A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted.

55
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:49,350
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

56
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,437
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.

57
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,106
"You'll need her father
on your side."

58
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:00,926
I thought being King
meant I could do whatever I wanted.

59
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,408
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

60
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,203
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

61
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,913
What?

62
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,628
An inspiring sight for the people?

63
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,590
Come, bow before your King!
Bow, you shits!

64
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,234
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

65
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,944
The Knight of the Flowers.

66
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,792
Thank you, Ser Loras.

67
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,528
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

68
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,615
I can't watch.

69
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,787
100 gold dragons on the Mountain.

70
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,872
- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy

71
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,792
with 100 gold dragons?
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

72
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,034
Or a girl
from the pleasure houses of Lys?

73
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,642
Or you could even buy a friend.

74
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,604
He's going to die.

75
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,802
Ser Loras rides well.

76
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,249
Such a shame.

77
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:22,085
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

78
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,884
And tell me, Lord Renly,
when will you be having your friend?

79
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,354
Loras knew his mare was in heat.

80
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,148
Quite crafty, really.

81
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,691
Ser Loras would never do that.

82
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,776
- There's no honor in tricks.
- No honor

83
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,346
and quite a bit of gold.

84
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:52,018
Sword!

85
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,751
Leave him be!

86
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,669
Stop this madness
in the name of your King!

87
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,907
Let him go!

88
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,604
I owe you my life, Ser.

89
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,033
I'm no Ser.

90
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,132
Remove his hood.

91
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,074
<i>On that Eve, the captive Imp</i>

92
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,996
<i>downwards from his horse did limp</i>

93
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:40,715
<i>no more would he preen and primp</i>

94
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,076
<i>in garb of red and gold.</i>

95
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,641
This isn't the Kingsroad.
You said we were riding for Winterfell.

96
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,149
I did... Often and loudly.

97
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:49,767
Very wise.

98
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:54,404
They'll be out in droves,
looking for me in the wrong place.

99
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:57,272
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

100
00:10:57,652 --> 00:10:59,952
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

101
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,372
Everyone knows a Lannister
always pays his debts.

102
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:05,916
Would you be so good as to untie me?

103
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,780
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

104
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,883
Am I going to run? The hill tribes
would kill me for my boots.

105
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,467
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

106
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,470
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

107
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,477
Ah, the eastern road.

108
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,069
We're going to the Vale.

109
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:28,264
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

110
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,198
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was
the last time you saw your sister?

111
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:33,527
Five years ago.

112
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:34,945
She's changed.

113
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:39,864
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

114
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,293
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I!

115
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:46,049
I had nothing to do with the
attempt on your son's life.

116
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:49,251
What sort of imbecile
arms an assassin with his own blade?

117
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,462
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

118
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,464
Am I starting to make sense?

119
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,536
My Lady, this way.

120
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,033
Untie me.

121
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,034
If I die, what's the point?

122
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,571
Rodrik?

123
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,089
I'll be fine, My Lady.

124
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,848
There's no need to bloody yourself.

125
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,324
Your first?

126
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,743
You need a woman.

127
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,059
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

128
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,147
I'm willing if she is.

129
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,455
The Iron Islands.

130
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:50,998
Sigil: a Kraken.

131
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:53,751
Words: "We do not sow."

132
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,961
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

133
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,423
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

134
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,870
And failed rebellions.

135
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:06,948
Sigil: a stag...

136
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:09,683
A crowned stag
now that Robert's King.

137
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,811
- Good.
- Words: "Ours is the fury."

138
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,840
Lords: the Baratheons.

139
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,217
The Westerlands.

140
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,859
Sigil: a lion.

141
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,465
Words:
"A Lannister always pays his debts."

142
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,043
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

143
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:28,655
Lords: the Lannisters.

144
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,474
We're still on their words.

145
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:33,093
- I don't know them.
- You do know them. Think.

146
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:36,019
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."

147
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,420
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

148
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:40,047
House Hornwood.

149
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,128
"Family, duty, honor."

150
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,784
Those are Tully words...
your mother's.

151
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,829
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honor...

152
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,224
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

153
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,601
Family comes first?

154
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:57,064
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

155
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:59,696
How can she protect the family

156
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:01,790
if she's not with her family?

157
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,532
Your mother sat by your bed
for three weeks...

158
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:10,005
- While you slept...
- And then she left!

159
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:15,124
When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

160
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,554
I placed you in her arms.

161
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:22,901
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

162
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:25,606
she will love you.

163
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,511
Absolutely.

164
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,722
Fiercely.

165
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:32,766
Why did she leave?

166
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,103
I still can't tell you,
but she will be home soon.

167
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,124
Do you know where she is now?

168
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,277
- Today?
- No, I don't.

169
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:43,054
Then how can you promise me
she'll be home soon?

170
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:48,157
Sometimes I worry you're too smart
for your own good.

171
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,786
I'll never shoot another arrow.

172
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,931
And where is that written?

173
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,360
You need legs to work a bow.

174
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,674
If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed
actually works,

175
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,311
you could learn to shoot a bow
from horseback.

176
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:05,341
Really?

177
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,654
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

178
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:10,804
Why shouldn't you?

179
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,687
Keep it down.

180
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:31,645
You're not supposed
to be inside the castle walls.

181
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,017
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

182
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,378
Important enough
for the likes of you.

183
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,835
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

184
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,049
Who, the Imp?

185
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:44,146
I'd call him half a nobleman.

186
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,272
Jealous?

187
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,124
Why should I be jealous?

188
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,220
Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket
can own you for the night.

189
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:54,133
What's a dwarf like down below?

190
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,216
I've always wondered.

191
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,335
Might surprise you.

192
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:02,014
He's good with his fingers too.

193
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:04,078
And his tongue.

194
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:06,561
Generous tipper.

195
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,547
I guess gold is cheap
for a Lannister.

196
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:11,790
You are jealous.

197
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,398
I'm a Greyjoy.

198
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:15,983
We've been lords of the Iron Islands
for 300 years.

199
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,807
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

200
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,693
not even the Lannisters.

201
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,043
And what about the Starks?

202
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,339
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

203
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,967
A ward... that's a nice word for it.

204
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,429
Your father rebelled against King Robert
and if he does it again...

205
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,910
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

206
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,768
What did your father do?

207
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,017
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

208
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,439
You're a very serious boy.

209
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,113
I'm not a boy.

210
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:46,734
Oh yes, you are.

211
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,939
A serious boy

212
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,191
with a serious cock.

213
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,687
I don't want to pay for it.

214
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,355
Then get yourself a wife.

215
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:01,273
Come on.

216
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:05,420
I'm not gonna hurt you.

217
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,164
How is your son, My Lord?

218
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,723
He'll never walk again.

219
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,193
But his mind is sound?

220
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,771
So they say.

221
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:27,092
A blessing then.

222
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:32,112
I suffered
an early mutilation myself.

223
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,491
Some doors close forever...

224
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,953
Others open
in the most unexpected places.

225
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,250
May I?

226
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:51,298
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

227
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,952
off comes my head.

228
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,552
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

229
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:59,774
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

230
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,434
But there are things you must know.

231
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:05,562
You are the King's Hand
and the King is a fool...

232
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,814
your friend, I know, but a fool...

233
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,900
and doomed unless you save him.

234
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,947
I've been in the capital a month.

235
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,427
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

236
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:19,284
I didn't trust you.

237
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:21,661
So why do you trust me now?

238
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:25,415
The Queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

239
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,919
There are few men of honor
in the Capital.

240
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,609
You are one of them.

241
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:32,456
I would like to believe I am another,

242
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,364
strange as that may seem.

243
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:37,006
What sort of doom does the King face?

244
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,676
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

245
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,921
The tears of Lys, they call it.

246
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:46,463
A rare and costly thing,

247
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,636
as clear and tasteless as water.

248
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,081
It leaves no trace.

249
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,146
Who gave it to him?

250
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,613
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

251
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,128
There were many.

252
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:08,711
Lord Arryn was a kind
and trusting man.

253
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:11,365
There was one boy.

254
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,880
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

255
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,481
The squire, Ser Hugh?

256
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,764
Pity what happened to him,

257
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:23,877
just when his life seemed
to be going so nicely.

258
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:27,874
If Ser Hugh poisoned him...

259
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:31,231
Who paid Ser Hugh?

260
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,568
Someone who could afford it.

261
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:36,384
Jon was a man of peace.

262
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:38,989
He was Hand for 17 years...

263
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,672
17 good years.

264
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:42,565
Why kill him?

265
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:47,289
He started asking questions.

266
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,659
He's found one bastard already.

267
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,567
He has the book.

268
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,188
The rest will come.

269
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,354
And when he knows
the truth, what will he do?

270
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,364
The gods alone know.

271
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:29,537
The fools tried to kill his son.

272
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,899
What's worse... they botched it.

273
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,048
The wolf and the lion will be
at each other's throats.

274
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,253
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?

275
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,067
We're not ready.

276
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:47,048
If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

277
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:49,193
This Hand is not the other.

278
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:51,426
We need time.

279
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:54,828
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

280
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:56,435
You know how these savages are.

281
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,277
"Delay," you say.

282
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,056
"Move fast," I reply.

283
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:03,401
This is no longer
a game for two players.

284
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:05,334
It never was.

285
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:28,168
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

286
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,175
I admire your industry.

287
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,735
You do move quietly.

288
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,910
We all have our qualities.

289
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,536
You look a bit lonely today.

290
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,987
You should pay a visit to my brothel
this evening.

291
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,406
First boy is on the house.

292
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:46,796
I think you're mistaking
business with pleasure.

293
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:47,922
Am I?

294
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:52,256
All those birds
that whisper in your ear...

295
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:54,249
such pretty little things.

296
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:56,844
Trust me,

297
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,492
we accommodate all inclinations.

298
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:02,597
I'm sure.

299
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:05,857
Lord Redwyne likes his boys
very young, I hear.

300
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:09,260
I'm a purveyor
of beauty and discretion...

301
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:10,765
both equally important.

302
00:23:11,027 --> 00:23:14,499
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

303
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:18,449
Is it true
that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone

304
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:19,649
prefers amputees?

305
00:23:20,223 --> 00:23:22,944
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

306
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,523
And I heard the most awful rumor
about a certain lord

307
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:28,491
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

308
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,871
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

309
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,709
The logistics alone...

310
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,251
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

311
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,428
Strictly speaking, such a thing

312
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,505
would not be in accordance
with the King's laws.

313
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:44,153
Strictly speaking.

314
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,553
Tell me...

315
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:52,626
does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

316
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,708
I've often wondered.

317
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:59,713
Do you know I have no idea
where they are?

318
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,847
And we had been so close.

319
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:07,263
But enough about me. How have you
been since we last saw each other?

320
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,991
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

321
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:13,411
Now the last time I saw you, you
were talking to the Hand of the King.

322
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,352
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

323
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:17,999
Council business.

324
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:21,086
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

325
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,335
Everyone's well aware
of your enduring fondness

326
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,091
for Lord Stark's wife.

327
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:30,095
If the Lannisters were behind
the attempt on the Stark boy's life

328
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:34,559
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

329
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,240
To think

330
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:39,269
a simple word to the Queen...

331
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,462
One shudders at the thought.

332
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:44,428
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

333
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:46,276
even more recently
than you have seen me.

334
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,687
Have you?

335
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,199
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

336
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,493
seeing you talking to Lord Stark
in his chambers.

337
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:55,910
Was that you under the bed?

338
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,772
And not long after that

339
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,210
when I saw you escorting a certain

340
00:25:01,162 --> 00:25:02,898
foreign dignitary...

341
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,732
Council business?

342
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,532
Of course you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

343
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,761
You're from there yourself,
after all.

344
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:15,390
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

345
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,403
I'd like to think we are.

346
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,145
So you can imagine my burden,

347
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:23,940
wondering if the King might
question my friend's sympathies.

348
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:27,986
To stand at a crossroads where
turning left means loyalty to a friend,

349
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,946
turning right loyalty to the realm...

350
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,030
Please.

351
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:34,409
To find myself in a position
where a simple word to the King...

352
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:36,494
What are you two conspiring about?

353
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:40,081
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

354
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:43,251
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

355
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:46,171
Disturbing news from far away.

356
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:48,798
Haven't you heard?

357
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,872
Off with you. No begging.

358
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:22,874
I'm not a beggar. I live here.

359
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,209
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

360
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,917
I want to see my father.

361
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,923
I want to fuck the Queen,
for all the good it does me.

362
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:31,799
You want your father, boy?

363
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,173
He's lying on the floor
of some tavern,

364
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,012
getting pissed on by his friends.

365
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,805
My father is Hand of the King!

366
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,184
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell

367
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,704
and if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

368
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,774
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

369
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,833
on the ear to help with your hearing?

370
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,158
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

371
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,746
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

372
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:02,914
Who did?

373
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,750
I didn't see them,
but I think one was fat.

374
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,212
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

375
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,215
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

376
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,050
Something about the savage.

377
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,510
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

378
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,929
near the dragon skulls.

379
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,681
What were you doing in the dungeons?

380
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:22,225
Chasing a cat.

381
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:26,854
Pardon, My Lord.

382
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:29,038
There's a Night's Watchman
here begging a word.

383
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,692
He says it's urgent.

384
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:40,076
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

385
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,913
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!

386
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:45,581
Did Benjen send you?

387
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:47,542
No one sent me, My Lord.

388
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm here to find men for the Wall,

389
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,880
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

390
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,592
- We'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, My Lord.

391
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,928
But that's not why I disturb you now.

392
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,137
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black...

393
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,184
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

394
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,229
It's for his sake I rode here so hard

395
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,123
I damn near killed my horse.

396
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,525
There are others riding too.

397
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,939
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

398
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,154
Know what?

399
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:19,719
Best said in private, My Lord.

400
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:28,012
Go on.
We'll talk more later.

401
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,565
Jory, take her safely to her room.

402
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:34,589
Come along, My Lady.
You heard your father.

403
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,278
How many guards does my father have?

404
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:44,599
Here in King's Landing?
50.

405
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:47,951
You wouldn't let
anyone kill him, would you?

406
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:50,451
No fear on that count, little lady.

407
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:57,945
- Well?
- It's about your wife, My Lord.

408
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:02,033
She's taken the Imp.

409
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,096
- You're far from home, Lady Stark.
- To whom do I speak?

410
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,141
Ser Vardis Egan, Knight of the Vale.
Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?

411
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:29,394
There was no time.

412
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:31,727
May I ask, My Lady,

413
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,257
why he is with you?

414
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,667
That's why there was no time.

415
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,487
- He's my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like it.

416
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,804
My sister will decide
what he looks like.

417
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:46,644
She will at that.

418
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,421
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

419
00:29:57,674 --> 00:29:59,962
Give me 10 good men
and some climbing spikes,

420
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,634
I'll impregnate the bitch.

421
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,519
I like you.

422
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:18,568
Your presence has been requested
in the small council chamber.

423
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,946
- A meeting has been called.
- I need to see the King first, alone.

424
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,282
The King
is at the small council meeting.

425
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,734
He has summoned you.

426
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:27,702
Is it about my wife?

427
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:32,165
I believe it concerns
Daenerys Targaryen.

428
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,083
The whore is pregnant.

429
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,592
You're speaking of murdering a child.

430
00:30:36,842 --> 00:30:40,193
I warned you this would happen.
Back in the North, I warned you,

431
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:42,356
but you didn't care to hear.

432
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,150
Hear it now.

433
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,763
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

434
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:49,891
And that fool Viserys as well.

435
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,893
Is that plain enough for you?

436
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,421
I want them both dead.

437
00:30:53,671 --> 00:30:56,063
You will dishonor yourself forever
if you do this.

438
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,190
Honor?

439
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,608
I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule!

440
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,254
One King, Seven Kingdoms.

441
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:05,219
Do you think honor
keeps them in line?

442
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,451
Do you think
honor's keeping the peace?

443
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:11,996
- It's fear, fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than Mad King.

444
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,918
Careful, Ned. Careful now.

445
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:16,096
You want to assassinate a girl

446
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:18,070
because the Spider heard a rumor?

447
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,005
No rumor, My Lord.
The princess is with child.

448
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,813
Based on whose information?

449
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:24,425
Ser Jorah Mormont.

450
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,974
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

451
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,406
You bring us
the whispers of a traitor

452
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,890
half a world away, and call it fact?

453
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,811
Jorah Mormont's
a slaver, not a traitor.

454
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,272
Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.

455
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,942
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

456
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:44,003
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

457
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:45,780
And if he's right?

458
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,338
If she has a son?

459
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:51,294
A Targaryen at the head
of a dothraki army...

460
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:54,837
- What then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

461
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:59,474
I'll fear the Dothraki the day
they teach their horses to run on water.

462
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:00,774
Do nothing?

463
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,812
That's your wise advice?

464
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:06,948
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

465
00:32:07,764 --> 00:32:09,695
You're my council.
Counsel!

466
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:12,538
Speak sense to this honorable fool.

467
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,604
I understand your misgivings,
My Lord, truly, I do.

468
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:22,483
It is a terrible thing we must consider,
a vile thing.

469
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,639
Yet we who presume to rule

470
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:28,787
must sometimes do vile things
for the good of the realm.

471
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,355
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son,

472
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:34,328
the realm will bleed.

473
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,747
I bear this girl no ill will,

474
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,656
but should the Dothraki invade,

475
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:42,670
how many innocents will die?
How many towns will burn?

476
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,923
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

477
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,209
that she should die now

478
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:51,804
so that tens of thousands might live?

479
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,316
We should have had them both
killed years ago.

480
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,892
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

481
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,600
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

482
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,399
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

483
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:11,157
I followed you into war,

484
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:13,596
twice,

485
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,410
without doubts,

486
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:18,623
without second thoughts.

487
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:21,424
But I will not follow you now.

488
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,465
The Robert I grew up with

489
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:28,198
didn't tremble
at the shadow of an unborn child.

490
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:31,969
She dies.

491
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:35,431
I will have no part in it.

492
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,674
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

493
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:41,228
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.

494
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:51,238
And good luck to him.

495
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,033
I thought you were a better man.

496
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,327
Out.
Out, damn you.

497
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,037
I'm done with you.

498
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:02,095
Go, run back to Winterfell!

499
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,676
I'll have your head on a spike!

500
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,203
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

501
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:12,741
You think you're too good for this?
Too proud and honorable?

502
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:14,261
This is a war!

503
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:20,101
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready, do it yourself.

504
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,735
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, My Lord.

505
00:34:22,985 --> 00:34:25,004
Lord Baelish is here for you.

506
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:30,486
He went on about you at some length
after you took your leave.

507
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:33,197
The word "treason" was mentioned.

508
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,075
What can I do for you?

509
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:38,536
When do you return to Winterfell?

510
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,205
- What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

511
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,458
I'll take you to the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

512
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:47,824
If that sort of thing
still interests you.

513
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:50,138
I don't have the time.

514
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,970
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

515
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,017
Round up all the men we have,
station em outside the girls' chambers.

516
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:05,688
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

517
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,258
Find them and meet me at the stables.

518
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:16,282
You bring him here
without permission?

519
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:19,285
You pollute my home
with his presence?

520
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,123
Your aunt has done
a bad thing, Robin,

521
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,755
a very bad thing.

522
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:28,294
You remember her, don't you?

523
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:31,326
Isn't he beautiful?

524
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,883
And strong too.
Jon knew it.

525
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:36,969
His last words were
"The seed is strong."

526
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:39,221
He wanted everyone to know

527
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,517
what a good, strong boy
his son would grow up to be.

528
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:46,312
Look at him,
the Lord of all the Vale.

529
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,639
Lysa,

530
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,899
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

531
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:52,276
warning me...

532
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,035
To stay away from them!

533
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,282
Not to bring one here!

534
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,199
Mommy?

535
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,248
- Is that the bad man?
- It is.

536
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:05,979
He's little.

537
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:09,126
He's Tyrion the Imp
of House Lannister.

538
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:13,489
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

539
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:15,980
Did I kill him too?

540
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:17,676
I've been a very busy man.

541
00:36:18,183 --> 00:36:20,097
You will watch your tongue!

542
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:23,057
These men are knights of the Vale.

543
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,732
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

544
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:27,914
Every one of them would die for me.

545
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,398
If any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

546
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,901
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here.

547
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,731
Tell him, mommy!
Tell him!

548
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:37,952
My sweet boy.

549
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:40,681
He's just trying to frighten us.

550
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,785
Lannisters are all liars.

551
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:45,287
No one will hurt my baby.

552
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,061
Mommy...

553
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,918
I want to see the bad man fly.

554
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,840
Perhaps you will, my little love.

555
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,382
This man is my prisoner.

556
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,352
I will not have him harmed.

557
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:02,862
Ser Vardis,

558
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,725
my sister's guest is weary.

559
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:08,644
Take him down below so he can rest.

560
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:11,343
Introduce him to Mord.

561
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,902
You go sleep, dwarf man.

562
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,548
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

563
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:56,746
Lord Stark's lucky
he still has a head.

564
00:37:57,223 --> 00:37:59,560
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

565
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,146
He adores the man.

566
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:02,865
You're jealous.

567
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:06,619
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

568
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,616
And you'd prefer me like this?

569
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:16,763
If you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

570
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:17,755
I want you.

571
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:22,751
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

572
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,627
He treats me
as if I'm a spoiled child.

573
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,682
And you're not?

574
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,019
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

575
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:34,347
How many wars have you fought in?

576
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:37,738
And how much did your father
spend on that armor of yours?

577
00:38:37,863 --> 00:38:38,863
Hold still.

578
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,437
All I hear from Robert and Stannis

579
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:45,796
is how I'm not tough enough,
how I squirm at the sight of blood...

580
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:48,155
You did vomit
when that boy's eye was knocked out.

581
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,489
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

582
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:52,785
He shouldn't have entered
if he didn't know how to fight.

583
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,290
Easy for you to say.

584
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,688
Not everyone is such
a gifted swordsman.

585
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:58,945
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

586
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,789
I'm good because I work at it...

587
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,634
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

588
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:07,930
I could work at fighting all day,
and still never be as good as you.

589
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,349
Yes well, I guess we'll never know.

590
00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:22,119
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

591
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:24,912
So how did it end up?

592
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:26,992
The Targaryen girl will die?

593
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,847
It needs to be done,
unpleasant as it is.

594
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:32,582
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

595
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:36,393
Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.

596
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:39,226
It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

597
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:41,755
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

598
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:44,034
You have to give it
to the Lannisters...

599
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,844
They may be the most pompous cunts,
the gods suffered to walk the world,

600
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,120
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

601
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:53,648
I have an outrageous amount of money.

602
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:55,686
Not as much as the Lannisters.

603
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:58,394
But a lot more than you.

604
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:02,214
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

605
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:04,754
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

606
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:07,100
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

607
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:09,984
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

608
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:13,791
But Robert loves his killing.

609
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:15,739
And he's the King.

610
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,402
How did that ever happen?

611
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:19,548
Because he loves his killing.

612
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:21,296
And he used to be good at it.

613
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,368
Do you know who should be king?

614
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:27,183
- Be serious.
- I am.

615
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:29,488
My father could be your bank.

616
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:32,890
I've never fought in a war before,
but I'd fight for you.

617
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,641
I'm fourth in line.

618
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,391
And where was Robert
in the line of royal succession?

619
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:40,105
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

620
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,816
- Stannis?
- He has the personality of a lobster.

621
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,595
He's still my older brother.

622
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,779
What?

623
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,322
- Look at it.
- You cut me.

624
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,760
It's just blood. We've all got it in us.
Sometimes a little spills.

625
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:55,413
If you become King,
you're going to see a lot of this.

626
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,228
You need to get used to it.

627
00:40:57,851 --> 00:40:59,374
Go on. Look.

628
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:04,004
People love you.

629
00:41:05,402 --> 00:41:07,466
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

630
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:09,652
They want to be near you.

631
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,834
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

632
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:17,839
but you don't gloat over it.

633
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:20,270
You don't love killing.

634
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,512
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

635
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:30,656
That thrones are only made

636
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,601
for the hated and the feared?

637
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,547
You would be a wonderful king.

638
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,517
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

639
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:01,406
You seemed so good together.

640
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:04,098
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

641
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,821
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

642
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:15,317
I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

643
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,863
He's not serious enough.

644
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:22,162
I'll say this for Ned Stark:

645
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:23,375
he's serious enough.

646
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,794
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

647
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:29,379
I don't know.

648
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:34,169
But I do know this:

649
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,716
If the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

650
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:43,921
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

651
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:47,982
we won't be able to stop them.

652
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,360
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

653
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,529
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.

654
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:55,521
They don't have siege weapons.

655
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:57,390
It's a neat little trick you do:

656
00:42:57,515 --> 00:43:00,502
You move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

657
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:03,362
Is my father wrong?

658
00:43:07,345 --> 00:43:09,945
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

659
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,758
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers
at his back.

660
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,505
We hole up in our castles...

661
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:17,488
a wise move...

662
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,110
Only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

663
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:24,277
They leave us in our castles.

664
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:28,232
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

665
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:31,924
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall,

666
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:34,682
stealing all our crops and livestock,

667
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,159
enslaving all our women and children.

668
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,733
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms

669
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:41,787
stand behind their absentee King,

670
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,804
their cowardly King
hiding behind high walls?

671
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,633
When do the people decide

672
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,304
that Viserys Targaryen
is the rightful monarch after all?

673
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:54,869
We still outnumber them.

674
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:59,786
Which is the bigger number,
five or one?

675
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:02,516
Five.

676
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:04,858
Five...

677
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,396
One.

678
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,793
One army, a real army,

679
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,903
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

680
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,672
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

681
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,662
Now we've got as many armies

682
00:44:24,345 --> 00:44:27,209
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

683
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:29,793
And everybody wants
something different.

684
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,129
Your father wants to own the world.

685
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,839
Ned Stark wants to run away

686
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,546
and bury his head in the snow.

687
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,967
What do you want?

688
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:50,147
We haven't had a real fight
in nine years.

689
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:53,561
Back-stabbing doesn't
prepare you for a fight.

690
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:55,694
And that's all the realm is now:

691
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,945
back-stabbing and scheming

692
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,399
and arse-licking and money-grubbing.

693
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:04,330
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

694
00:45:05,862 --> 00:45:07,122
Our marriage.

695
00:45:17,738 --> 00:45:19,442
So here we sit

696
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,012
17 years later,

697
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:24,473
holding it all together.

698
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:27,563
Don't you get tired?

699
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:29,760
Every day.

700
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:34,542
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

701
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,186
17 years

702
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:38,904
is quite a long time.

703
00:45:39,992 --> 00:45:40,906
Yes, it is.

704
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,412
Yes, it is.

705
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:50,814
What was she like?

706
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:56,216
You've never asked about her,
not once.

707
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:57,367
Why not?

708
00:45:58,785 --> 00:46:01,501
At first, just saying
her name even in private

709
00:46:02,557 --> 00:46:04,955
felt like I was breathing
life back into her.

710
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:10,245
I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

711
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:12,973
When I realized
that wasn't going to happen,

712
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:15,686
I refused to ask out of spite.

713
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:20,028
I didn't want to give you
the satisfaction of thinking I cared.

714
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:24,741
And eventually it became clear that
my spite didn't mean anything to you.

715
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:27,661
As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.

716
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:29,241
So why now?

717
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:35,129
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

718
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:38,943
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

719
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,948
You want to know the horrible truth?

720
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,267
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

721
00:46:53,954 --> 00:46:55,590
I only know she was

722
00:46:56,215 --> 00:46:58,136
the one thing I ever wanted...

723
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:02,642
Someone took her away from me,

724
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:08,302
and Seven Kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

725
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:14,916
I felt something
for you once, you know?

726
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:17,360
I know.

727
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,647
Even after we lost our first boy.

728
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:24,718
For quite a while, actually.

729
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:30,765
Was it ever possible for us?

730
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,390
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

731
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:48,906
Does that make you
feel better or worse?

732
00:47:54,014 --> 00:47:55,764
It doesn't make me feel anything.

733
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:12,330
She looks like him,

734
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:14,270
don't she, My Lord?

735
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:17,565
She has his nose, his black hair.

736
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:22,472
Tell him when you see him, My Lord.

737
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:23,912
If it please you,

738
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,730
tell him how beautiful she is.

739
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:29,448
I will.

740
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,203
And tell him
I've been with no one else.

741
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:35,183
I swear it, My Lord,
by the old gods and new.

742
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,662
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

743
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:39,095
just him.

744
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,503
The King was always good to me.

745
00:48:41,828 --> 00:48:43,672
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

746
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:45,590
what did he want?

747
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,788
He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord.

748
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:50,545
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

749
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:52,109
healthy.

750
00:48:55,911 --> 00:48:57,616
He looks healthy enough to me.

751
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:01,815
The girl shall want for nothing.

752
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:10,407
Brothels make a much better investment
than ships,

753
00:49:10,884 --> 00:49:11,975
I've found.

754
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,446
Whores rarely sink.

755
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,751
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

756
00:49:23,512 --> 00:49:25,551
He has more than you, for a start.

757
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:28,017
- How many?
- Does it matter?

758
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:30,927
If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

759
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,013
And Jon Arryn tracked
them all down. Why?

760
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,725
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

761
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,144
He was overcome with fatherly love.

762
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,690
Come.

763
00:49:50,256 --> 00:49:51,824
- Jory!
- My Lord.

764
00:50:11,472 --> 00:50:13,136
Such a small pack of wolves.

765
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,140
Stay back, Ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

766
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:18,912
Was the Hand of the King.

767
00:50:19,312 --> 00:50:21,978
Now I'm not sure what he is...
Lord of somewhere very far away.

768
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:27,689
- What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
- Get back inside where it's safe.

769
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,780
I'm looking for my brother.
You remember my brother, don't you?

770
00:50:32,336 --> 00:50:33,657
Blond hair, sharp tongue,

771
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:35,825
short man.

772
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:40,059
- I remember him well.
- He had some trouble on the road.

773
00:50:40,577 --> 00:50:42,540
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

774
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:44,876
He was taken at my command

775
00:50:45,736 --> 00:50:46,961
to answer for his crimes.

776
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,456
I'll bring the City Watch.

777
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:55,703
Come, Stark.

778
00:50:56,673 --> 00:50:58,473
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

779
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,442
- If you threaten My Lord again...
- Threaten?

780
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:01,778
As in,

781
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:04,674
"I'm going to open your lord
from balls to brains

782
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:06,481
"and see what Starks are made of"?

783
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:08,653
You kill me,

784
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:11,859
your brother's a dead man.

785
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:13,849
You're right.

786
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:16,324
Take him alive.
Kill his men.

787
00:52:52,494 --> 00:52:55,361
My brother, Lord Stark...
We want him back.
