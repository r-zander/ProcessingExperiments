2
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,411
Left high, left low.

3
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,306
Right low,

4
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,572
lunge right.

5
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,438
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

6
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:41,370
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

7
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,594
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

8
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,179
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

9
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:48,830
She always comes back with
scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.

10
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,088
Go back to your room.

11
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:55,257
Bar the doors

12
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,389
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

13
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:00,582
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

14
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:01,708
Run!

15
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,827
Left, right.

16
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:24,705
Now you are dead.

17
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:26,864
You said right,

18
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,253
- but you went left.
- And now you are a dead girl.

19
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,505
Only 'cause you lied.

20
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:36,224
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

21
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,433
- You were not seeing.
- I was so.

22
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,307
- I watched, but you...
- Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

23
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,560
The seeing,

24
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,530
the true seeing,

25
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,363
that is the heart of swordplay.

26
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,114
Arya Stark,

27
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,908
Come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

28
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,057
And why is it that Lord Eddard

29
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:09,500
is sending Lannister men
in place of his own? I am wondering.

30
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,670
Mind your place, dancing master.

31
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,883
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

32
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,264
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

33
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,019
- Take her.
- Are you men or snakes,

34
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,645
that you would threaten a child?

35
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,856
Get out of my way, little man.

36
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:35,276
I am Syrio Forel...

37
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,527
Foreign bastard.

38
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:43,826
And you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

39
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,329
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

40
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:51,196
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,210
Run to your father.

42
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:15,377
Bloody oafs.

43
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,527
Be gone now, Arya.

44
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,911
Come with me.

45
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:21,752
Run.

46
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,576
The first sword of Braavos
does not run.

47
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,591
What do we say to the God of death?

48
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:43,511
Not today.

49
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:46,472
Go.

50
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,667
Not today. Not today.

51
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,388
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

52
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,349
I'll tell the Queen.

53
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,936
Who do you think sent me?

54
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,200
Needle.

55
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:52,830
There she is.

56
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,083
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

57
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,793
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

58
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,505
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me... the Queen!

59
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,507
Stay away!

60
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,038
Lord Stark,

61
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,248
you must be thirsty.

62
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:44,138
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

63
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:48,311
Why is it no one
ever trusts the eunuch?

64
00:07:56,854 --> 00:08:00,600
Not so much, My Lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.

65
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:04,509
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

66
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:08,097
What about my daughters?

67
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,274
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

68
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,681
Even my little birds cannot find her.

69
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,975
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

70
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,855
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

71
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,089
All dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

72
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:29,826
You watched my men being slaughtered
and did nothing.

73
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,701
And would again, My Lord.

74
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,392
I was unarmed, unarmored
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

75
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,561
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

76
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,181
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

77
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:50,108
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

78
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,730
The madness of mercy.

79
00:08:56,964 --> 00:09:00,583
- That she might save her children.
- The children.

80
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,199
It is always the innocents
who suffer.

81
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,422
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

82
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,003
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

83
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:13,012
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

84
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,189
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

85
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,734
The Queen can't kill me.

86
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,244
Cat holds her brother.

87
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,116
The wrong brother sadly.

88
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,526
And lost to her.

89
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,244
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

90
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,675
If that's true,

91
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,339
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

92
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,542
Not today, My Lord.

93
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,600
Tell me something, Varys.

94
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,289
Who do you truly serve?

95
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:02,257
The Realm, My Lord.

96
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:03,954
Someone must.

97
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:24,541
It's Othor,

98
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,433
without a doubt.

99
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,171
The other one is Jafer Flowers,

100
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,861
less the hand the wolf tore off.

101
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,676
Any sign of Benjen

102
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,592
or the rest of his party?

103
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:37,653
Just these two, My Lord.

104
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,884
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

105
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:42,518
The smell.

106
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,363
What smell?

107
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,206
There is none.

108
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,237
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

109
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,929
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, My Lord.

110
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:00,416
Fire will do for them.

111
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,787
The Wildling way.

112
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,388
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

113
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:09,544
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

114
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:12,298
Get them inside.

115
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,550
You heard him.

116
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,436
Lord Commander,

117
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,723
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers...

118
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,601
a raven from King's Landing.

119
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,778
Come on, move 'em out.

120
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,757
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

121
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:43,417
and pour one for yourself.

122
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,800
The King is dead.

123
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:10,643
Is there any word of my father?

124
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:12,152
Sit.

125
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,693
Lord Stark has been

126
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,159
charged with treason.

127
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:25,595
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

128
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:28,082
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

129
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:43,503
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

130
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,684
Your duty lies here now.

131
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:50,646
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

132
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:54,848
I'm sure they'll be

133
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:56,944
treated gently.

134
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,367
Your father has proved
to be an awful traitor, dear.

135
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:07,118
King Robert's body was still warm

136
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:11,166
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

137
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:13,772
He wouldn't do that.

138
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:16,505
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

139
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,633
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

140
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,303
Send for my father. He'll tell you...
The King was his friend.

141
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,798
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

142
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,433
Yet you are the daughter
of a traitor.

143
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,229
How can I allow you to marry my son?

144
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:35,315
A child born of a traitor's seed

145
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,776
is no fit consort for our King.

146
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,320
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

147
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:44,437
but in 10 years,
who knows what treasons she may hatch?

148
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,995
No, I'm not.
I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.

149
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,289
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise.

150
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:52,416
I won't hatch anything.

151
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,128
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

152
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:59,885
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

153
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:07,806
Little dove,

154
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,795
you must write to Lady Catelyn

155
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,554
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

156
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,761
Robb.

157
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,678
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

158
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,960
Best it comes from you.

159
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,863
If you would help your father, urge
your brother to keep the King's peace.

160
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,659
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

161
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,460
If I could see my father,
talk to him about...

162
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,423
You disappoint me, child.

163
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,678
We have told you
of your father's treason.

164
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,884
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

165
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,271
I only meant that...

166
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,144
What will happen to him?

167
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,022
That depends.

168
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,398
On...

169
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,101
- On what?
- On your brother.

170
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:05,963
And on you.

171
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,341
Treason?

172
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:19,670
Sansa wrote this?

173
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,130
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

174
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:25,974
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new King.

175
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,346
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

176
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:32,987
This is a royal command, My Lord.

177
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,644
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

178
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:40,583
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

179
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,278
But not alone.

180
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,115
Call the banners.

181
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,702
All of them, My Lord?

182
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,704
They've all sworn
to defend my father?

183
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,339
They have.

184
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:57,791
Now we see
what their words are worth.

185
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,721
Are you afraid?

186
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:15,966
I must be.

187
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:17,852
Good.

188
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,689
Why is that good?

189
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,816
It means you're not stupid.

190
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,133
You've had this since dawn?

191
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:51,814
He sent it to me, not you.

192
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,765
- I've shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

193
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:58,285
My husband has been taken prisoner.

194
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,936
My son intends to declare war.

195
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,471
A war?

196
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:04,149
Your son against the Lannisters?

197
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:06,860
You should go to him.

198
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:08,906
Teach him patience.

199
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,865
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

200
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:14,387
He is your brother by law!

201
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,495
Does family mean nothing to you?

202
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,097
Family means everything to me.

203
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,597
And I will not risk Robin's life

204
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:25,270
to get caught up
in another of your husband's wars.

205
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,505
I'm hungry.

206
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,560
Hush now, darling.

207
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,173
You just ate.

208
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,470
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

209
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,182
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

210
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,311
You're always welcome here, sister.

211
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,690
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight...

212
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,270
That is what I ask.

213
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,318
Go on, sweet.

214
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:52,296
Time for your bath.

215
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,619
I'll feed you after.

216
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,124
If you fear for the safety
of your son...

217
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,905
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

218
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,839
Are you an idiot?

219
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,131
They killed my husband.

220
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,259
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

221
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,803
These people will do anything.

222
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,763
And that is why we have to stop them.

223
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,478
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

224
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,188
where they belong,

225
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,450
to protect their Lord.

226
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,122
Will you shut up?

227
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,089
There's hill tribes all around here.

228
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:52,754
If I'm going to die, it mays as well be
with a song in my heart.

229
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:56,570
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

230
00:18:58,406 --> 00:18:59,944
What would you do then?

231
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:01,697
Starve, most likely.

232
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:04,344
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

233
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:09,039
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

234
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,065
Golden women?

235
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,191
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

236
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:17,272
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

237
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,629
But you knew that.

238
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:24,076
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honor.

239
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,120
Fair enough.

240
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,760
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

241
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,400
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

242
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,740
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

243
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,904
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

244
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,541
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

245
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,978
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

246
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,348
remember this:

247
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,230
Whatever their price,

248
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,473
I'll beat it.

249
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,372
I like living.

250
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:33,756
Come, share our fire.

251
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,017
Help yourselves to our goat.

252
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:46,210
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

253
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:48,765
Shagga Son of Dolf

254
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,026
of the Stone Crows sent you.

255
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:55,154
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

256
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,174
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

257
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:02,579
In my own bed, at the age of 80

258
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:06,223
with a belly full of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

259
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,179
Take the half man.

260
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,025
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

261
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:21,865
My House is rich and powerful.

262
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,323
If you see us
through these mountains,

263
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,304
my father will shower you with gold.

264
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,663
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

265
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,791
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

266
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,878
What do the Stone Crows do?

267
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,129
Hide behind rocks

268
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,064
and shiver
when the knights of the Vale ride by?

269
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,677
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

270
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,931
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

271
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:49,893
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

272
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:59,027
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

273
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:13,249
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

274
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:18,596
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

275
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,990
I will not give you trinkets.

276
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,760
I will give you this.

277
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,220
What is "this"?

278
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:29,015
The Vale of Arryn.

279
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:33,269
The Lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

280
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,921
The Lords of the Vale want me dead.

281
00:22:39,382 --> 00:22:41,361
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

282
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:52,205
Now there's a rare sight...

283
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,999
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

284
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,347
Stop, put it down!

285
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,852
Blood will always tell.

286
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:17,585
You'll hang for this, bastard.

287
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:40,378
I told you not to do anything stupid.

288
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,048
You're confined to quarters.
Go.

289
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:10,742
Ghost, what's wrong?

290
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:14,647
Is something out there?

291
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,062
Commander?

292
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:52,962
Stay.

293
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,006
Hello?

294
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:17,767
Who's there?

295
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,054
Lord Commander?

296
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:13,588
Move!

297
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:33,426
What did they do?

298
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:53,553
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

299
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,449
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

300
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,984
ships to sail to Westeros.

301
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:18,363
Jorah, make them stop.

302
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,307
You heard me.

303
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,280
These men have shed blood
for their Khal.

304
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:24,810
Now they claim their rewards.

305
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,076
You have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

306
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,688
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.

307
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,261
Come.

308
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,081
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

309
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,165
And those women there.

310
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,153
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

311
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,320
I can,

312
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:19,696
and I will.

313
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,051
Thank you, silver lady.

314
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,787
Who are you?

315
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,180
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.

316
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:48,326
My mother was Godswife
here before me.

317
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:50,951
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

318
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,954
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

319
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,551
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his...

320
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,703
lamb or lion,

321
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,425
his wound must be washed and sewn

322
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,878
or it will fester.

323
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:39,375
For 30 years

324
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,050
I've been making corpses
out of men, boy.

325
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,089
I'm the man you want
leading the Vanguard.

326
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,759
Galbart Glover will lead the Van.

327
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:51,470
The bloody Wall will melt

328
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,597
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

329
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,727
I will lead the Van

330
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,981
or I will take my men
and march them home.

331
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:09,738
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.

332
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:12,825
And when I am done
with the Lannisters,

333
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,159
I'll march back North,

334
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:16,662
root you out of your Keep

335
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:19,331
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

336
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:21,200
Oathbreaker, is it?!

337
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:25,515
I'll not sit here and swallow insults

338
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,917
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

339
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:43,731
My Lord father taught me

340
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,142
it was death to bare steel
against your Liege Lord.

341
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,863
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

342
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,508
Your meat...

343
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,905
is bloody tough.

344
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,302
- What is it? What's happened?
- It's all right.

345
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:42,873
Where are you going?

346
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,041
South. For father.

347
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:48,870
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

348
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,498
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

349
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,491
They have more men than we do.

350
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:55,857
Aye, they do.

351
00:34:57,432 --> 00:34:58,597
Can't I come with you?

352
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,357
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

353
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:03,310
And I won't get in the way, I...

354
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,642
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

355
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:07,898
Until I return that will be you.

356
00:35:10,906 --> 00:35:13,612
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

357
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,693
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

358
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,731
I will.

359
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:24,030
I'll send letters whenever I can,

360
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,091
but if you don't hear from me,

361
00:35:26,814 --> 00:35:28,180
don't be scared.

362
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:34,677
Until I return.

363
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,698
How long have you been
hiding out there?

364
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,076
Robb will be looking for you

365
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,424
to say goodbye.

366
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,334
They've all gone away.

367
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,332
They'll be back soon.

368
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,669
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

369
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:13,952
No, they won't.

370
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,580
Please watch over Robb.

371
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:24,802
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

372
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:27,350
And Theon too, I suppose.

373
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,807
You hear them, boy?

374
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,280
The Old Gods are answering you.

375
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:40,491
What are you doing here?

376
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:42,843
They're my Gods too.

377
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,916
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

378
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,169
Even slaves are allowed to pray.

379
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,462
You're not a slave.

380
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,260
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

381
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,947
I'm not complaining, Little Lord,

382
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,387
just telling truths.

383
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:09,311
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

384
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,346
You asked them,

385
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,274
they're answering you.

386
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:18,987
Open your ears.

387
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,744
It's only the wind.

388
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:30,499
Who do you think sends the wind
if not the Gods?

389
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,460
They see you, boy.

390
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,461
They hear you.

391
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,099
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

392
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:43,178
The Old Gods have no power
in the South.

393
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,890
The Weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

394
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,685
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

395
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,940
Well, there's a big man.

396
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,778
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

397
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,239
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

398
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,312
Go dress.

399
00:38:04,437 --> 00:38:05,492
Hodor.

400
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:10,789
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

401
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:15,294
Giants and worse than giants.

402
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,173
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

403
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,635
All these swords,
they should be going North, boy.

404
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:25,721
North, not South!

405
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:30,100
The cold winds are rising.

406
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,161
They were touched by White Walkers.

407
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:52,122
That's why they came back.

408
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,486
That's why their eyes turned blue.

409
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,643
Only fire will stop them.

410
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,274
How do you know that?

411
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:04,384
I read about it in a book...

412
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,386
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

413
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,142
What else did the book say?

414
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,669
The White Walkers

415
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,979
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

416
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,525
And when they wake up...

417
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,154
And when they wake up, what?

418
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,618
I hope The Wall is high enough.

419
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,205
Summer snows, My Lady.

420
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,531
Robb's brought the North with him.

421
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:17,649
The River Lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

422
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:21,290
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

423
00:40:21,415 --> 00:40:23,880
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

424
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,674
One army or two,

425
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:28,969
the Kings in the North
threw back hosts

426
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,929
10 times as large.

427
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:41,690
You look well.

428
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,300
You're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

429
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:49,448
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

430
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,477
I had not thought to be here.

431
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,245
I would speak with my son alone.

432
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,581
I know you will forgive me, My Lords.

433
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,833
You heard her! Move your asses!

434
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,100
Come on, out.

435
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:04,973
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

436
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:06,965
Have no fear, My Lady.

437
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,634
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

438
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,429
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

439
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:14,890
You old devil, Rodrik.

440
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,402
You're not wasting away, are you?

441
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,930
I remember the day
you came into this world

442
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:34,757
red-faced and squalling.

443
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:39,126
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

444
00:41:40,224 --> 00:41:42,259
- There was no one else.
- No one?

445
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:45,128
Who were those men I saw here?

446
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,881
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

447
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:51,367
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell...

448
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,116
Would that I could.

449
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,025
There was...

450
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,444
a letter.

451
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:04,981
From Sansa.

452
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,235
From the Queen, you mean.

453
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,411
There's no mention of Arya.

454
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:32,187
How many men do you have?

455
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,201
18,000.

456
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:37,430
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

457
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,770
You would never be allowed to leave.

458
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:43,412
Our best hope, our only hope...

459
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:46,606
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

460
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:48,692
And if I lose?

461
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:51,319
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

462
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,754
when the Mad King fell?

463
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:54,758
They were butchered in their sleep.

464
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,042
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

465
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,578
And the years
have not made him kinder.

466
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,076
If you lose,

467
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,710
your father dies,

468
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:09,379
your sisters die,

469
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:11,423
we die.

470
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,052
Well, that makes it simple then.

471
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:19,389
I suppose it does.

472
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:45,851
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

473
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:48,670
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

474
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,420
Not best for me.

475
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:53,744
If the half man betrays us,

476
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:57,093
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood...

477
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,124
And feed it to the goats, yes.

478
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,604
All right then.

479
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,811
Time to meet my father.

480
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,762
Uncle.

481
00:44:42,189 --> 00:44:43,190
Father.

482
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:48,520
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

483
00:44:49,873 --> 00:44:51,428
Sorry to disappoint you.

484
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:55,485
And who are
these Companions of yours?

485
00:44:58,745 --> 00:45:01,353
This is Shagga Son of Dolf,

486
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:03,785
Chieftain of the Stone Crows.

487
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,206
Timett Son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.

488
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:10,375
This fair maid

489
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,808
is Chella daughter of Cheyk,

490
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:15,297
leader of the Black Ears.

491
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:17,716
And here we have Bronn son of...

492
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,177
You wouldn't know him.

493
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,423
May I present My Lord Father,

494
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,845
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

495
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,022
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

496
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,813
Kind of you to go to war for me.

497
00:45:39,205 --> 00:45:42,574
You left us no choice.
The honor of the House was at stake.

498
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:48,038
Your brother would never have submitted
to capture so meekly.

499
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:50,594
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

500
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,792
He's braver. I'm better looking.

501
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,586
He's been covering himself in glory.

502
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:58,268
Jaime smashed the River Lords
at the Golden Tooth,

503
00:45:58,393 --> 00:45:59,966
and now lays siege to Riverrun,

504
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,272
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

505
00:46:02,397 --> 00:46:05,221
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

506
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:08,391
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

507
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,584
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

508
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:12,395
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

509
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,105
Robert Baratheon is dead.

510
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:16,191
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

511
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:21,196
My sister rules, you mean.

512
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:24,115
Stark's son has called his banners.

513
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:26,409
He moves south with a strong host.

514
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:28,172
A green boy.

515
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,955
One taste of battle
and he'll run back to Winterfell

516
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,540
with his tail between his legs.

517
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:34,942
Maybe.

518
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:38,034
Though the boy
does have a certain belligerence.

519
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,089
You'd like him.

520
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,553
While we're on the subject of war,

521
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:47,347
I made promises to my friends here

522
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:49,849
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

523
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,811
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

524
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,053
plus swords,

525
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,940
pikes, gorgets, maces...

526
00:46:57,954 --> 00:47:00,402
if it please My Lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

527
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,946
that the Northmen
have crossed the neck.

528
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:07,446
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.

529
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:08,602
So be it.

530
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:11,699
Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

531
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,459
And send word to Jaime
that I am moving against Robb Stark.

532
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,972
At once, My Lord.

533
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,852
The men of the Mountain clans
are great warriors.

534
00:47:34,504 --> 00:47:36,187
Ride with me against my enemies

535
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,144
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

536
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:41,526
Only if the half man fights with us.

537
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,195
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

538
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:46,448
the little lion's life is ours.

539
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,124
The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves North.

540
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,177
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his Knights at a disadvantage.

541
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,340
We need to get around him
and break Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

542
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:07,218
Do that
and the River Lords will join us.

543
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,305
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at The Twins.

544
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:12,807
Lord Frey controls that bridge.

545
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,434
Your father's bannerman.

546
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,770
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

547
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:19,564
At the Trident, he didn't appear

548
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,264
until the battle was done.

549
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,570
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

550
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,413
Robb's right. We need that bridge.

551
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,182
So what's it going to be?

552
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:39,125
Do we move against Jaime

553
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,419
or Lord Tywin?

554
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,799
Your pardon.

555
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,302
We've captured a Lannister scout.

556
00:48:51,152 --> 00:48:52,138
Don't worry, lad.

557
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,516
He won't be leaving this tent
with his head.

558
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,685
Where did you find him?

559
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,854
In the brush above the encampment.

560
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,625
He looked to be counting.

561
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,785
How high did you get?

562
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:17,454
20,000. Maybe more.

563
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:22,752
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

564
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,504
My father unrstands mercy,
when there is room for it.

565
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,884
And he understands honor...

566
00:49:32,945 --> 00:49:34,045
and courage.

567
00:49:37,233 --> 00:49:38,685
Let him go.

568
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:57,250
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

569
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:02,041
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

570
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:05,455
Yes, My Lord.

571
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:07,422
Thank you.

572
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:20,618
Are you touched, boy?
Letting him go?

573
00:50:21,078 --> 00:50:22,596
You call me boy again.

574
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:25,588
Go on.

575
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,923
It is also the wish of His Grace

576
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,095
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

577
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,835
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

578
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:06,003
... be at once raised
to the rank of Lord...

579
00:51:06,658 --> 00:51:11,028
And granted the ancient seat
of Harrenhal,

580
00:51:11,747 --> 00:51:16,783
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor after him

581
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,576
until the end of time.

582
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:29,252
In place of the traitor Eddard Stark,
it is the wish of his Grace

583
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:33,924
that Tywin Lannister,
Lord of Casterly Rock

584
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:36,445
and Warden of the West,

585
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,253
be appointed Hand of the King.

586
00:51:40,424 --> 00:51:41,425
Lastly,

587
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:45,228
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

588
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:48,398
it is the view of the Council

589
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:52,734
that the life and safety
of King Joffrey

590
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:57,305
be of paramount importance.

591
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:00,993
Ser Barristan Selmy.

592
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:11,238
Your Grace, I am yours to command.

593
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,470
Rise, Ser Barristan.

594
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:16,538
You may remove your helm.

595
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,702
You have served the Realm
long and faithfully.

596
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:28,082
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

597
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,981
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

598
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:34,819
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

599
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,529
on your many years of service.

600
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,200
The Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

601
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,368
Our vows are taken for life.

602
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,872
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

603
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:49,667
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

604
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,503
You let my father die.

605
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:55,339
You're too old to protect anybody.

606
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,553
The Council has determined

607
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,055
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

608
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,325
as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

609
00:53:05,697 --> 00:53:09,061
He who profaned his blade with the blood
of the King he had sworn to defend!

610
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,329
Careful, Ser.

611
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,853
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good Ser.

612
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,837
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

613
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:20,156
with servants
to look after your every need.

614
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:22,408
A hole to die in

615
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,702
and men to bury me.

616
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:28,163
I am a Knight.

617
00:53:29,613 --> 00:53:31,866
I shall die a Knight.

618
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,593
A naked Knight, apparently.

619
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:55,565
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

620
00:53:59,682 --> 00:54:00,862
Here, boy!

621
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,508
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

622
00:54:21,284 --> 00:54:23,261
If any man in this hall
has other matters

623
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,637
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

624
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:29,483
or go forth and hold his silence.

625
00:54:32,892 --> 00:54:34,480
Your Grace.

626
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:37,699
Come forward, My Lady.

627
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:40,851
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.

628
00:54:42,822 --> 00:54:46,284
Do you have some business
for the King and the Council?

629
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:48,000
I do.

630
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,203
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

631
00:54:56,987 --> 00:54:59,574
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

632
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:02,592
Treason is a noxious weed.

633
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:06,804
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

634
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:09,515
I want to hear what she says.

635
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,975
Do you deny your father's crime?

636
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,950
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

637
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:20,943
All I ask is mercy.

638
00:55:21,493 --> 00:55:23,779
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

639
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:27,616
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him, you all know it.

640
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:32,009
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

641
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:35,958
They must have lied to him...
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis,

642
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,668
they must have lied!

643
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,516
He said I wasn't the King.

644
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:42,840
Why did he say that?

645
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,810
He was badly hurt.

646
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:47,093
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

647
00:55:48,419 --> 00:55:52,099
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

648
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:58,564
A child's faith...
such sweet innocence.

649
00:55:59,353 --> 00:56:03,443
And yet they say wisdom oft comes
from the mouths of babes.

650
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:05,078
Treason...

651
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,032
is treason!

652
00:56:12,011 --> 00:56:13,371
Anything else?

653
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:18,521
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

654
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:22,042
please do me this kindness,
Your Grace.

655
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,724
Your sweet words have moved me.

656
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,302
But your father has to confess.

657
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,600
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

658
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,363
or there'll be no mercy for him.

659
00:56:52,259 --> 00:56:53,260
He will.

660
00:56:58,376 --> 00:57:00,657
