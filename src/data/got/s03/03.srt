1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,796
<i>This march is a distraction.</i>

2
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:06,034
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:08,407
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

4
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:10,937
- No.
- Then it's a distraction.

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:13,881
- They're growing fast.
- Not fast enough.

6
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:15,474
I need an army.

7
00:00:15,504 --> 00:00:17,207
<i>We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.</i>

8
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,979
<i>Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.</i>

9
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,340
<i>The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.</i>

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,362
- Who are you?
- Thoros of Myr.

11
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,966
- Who do you fight for?
- The Brotherhood without Banners.

12
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,097
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

13
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,747
We're trying to save it.

14
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:35,078
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

15
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,175
I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.

16
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,778
I have been searching for you,
Daenerys Stormborn,

17
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:42,145
to ask your forgiveness.

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,982
I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.

19
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,850
I will not fail you again.

20
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,264
- What's wrong with him?
- He's a warg.

21
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:52,221
He can enter the mind of animals,
see through their eyes.

22
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,657
He's scouting for us.

23
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,592
Orell, where were you this time?

24
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:57,494
The Fist of the First Men.

25
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:00,214
- What did you see?
- Dead crows.

26
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:03,658
Get up, Tarly. I forbid you to die.

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,337
You're responsible for him.

28
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:07,406
Make sure he gets back alive.

29
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,659
So good to see you again, Clegane.

30
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:13,417
Girl.

31
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,948
What in seven hells

32
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,288
are you doing with the Stark bitch?

33
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,458
Get up.

34
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,446
Let us go and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

35
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,828
Enough to buy me a new head?

36
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:41,033

00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,314
<i>If I may, nephew,</i>

41
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:40,047
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill.

42
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,152
which may have some bearing..
- Why don't...

43
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,488
you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

44
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:47,357
And don't call him "nephew. " He is your king.

45
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:48,931
Robb knows I meant him no disr...

46
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:52,362
You're lucky I'm not your king.

47
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:56,071
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around
like a victory flag.

48
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,741
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

49
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:01,697
scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

50
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,080
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

51
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,744
if he's the only one winning any battles.

52
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,259
No, there's glory enough to go around.

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,148
It's not about glory.

54
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,762
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

55
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,054
I seized an opportunity.

56
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,989
What value was the mill?

57
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,411
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

58
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:20,592
Is he there now?

59
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:24,095
Of course not. We took the fight to him.
He could not withstand us.

60
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,331
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west,

61
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:31,569
into our country where
we could surround him and kill him.

62
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:33,705
I wanted him to chase us,

63
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:37,208
which he would have done because he is a mad dog

64
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,319
without a strategic thought in his head.

65
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,480
I could have that head on a spike by now.

66
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,352
Instead, I have a mill.

67
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,756
We took hostages.

68
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,513
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.

69
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,499
Martyn is 15, I believe.

70
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,094
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

71
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,876
Have I sued for peace?

72
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,411
No.

73
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,076
Do you think he'll sue for peace

74
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:15,784
because we have his father's

75
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,885
brother's great-grandsons?

76
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,058
No.

77
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,093
How many men did you lose?

78
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,833
208.

79
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,131
But for every man we lost, the Lannisters...

80
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:36,100
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

81
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,243
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,646
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,916
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

84
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,252
We seem to be running short of patience here.

85
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:54,721
You know who isn't?

86
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:58,128
Tywin Lannister.

87
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,442
Intimate. Lovely table.

88
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,283
Better chairs than the old small council chamber.

89
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:58,748
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

90
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:01,618
What news of Jaime?

91
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:09,959
20,000 unwashed Northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.

92
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:14,296
Collectively, you control more spies and
informants than the rest of the world combined.

93
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:17,942
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

94
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,371
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

95
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,061
What do we have, then?

96
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,550
Robb Stark and most of his
bannermen are in Riverrun

97
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,349
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

98
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:37,487
In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

99
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:41,090
which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

100
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,449
- in practice if not in name.
- Well, let him have it.

101
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,126
The name suits our purposes

102
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,452
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

103
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:51,144
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

104
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:54,269
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

105
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,905
Lady Arryn and I have known
each other since we were children.

106
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,010
She has always been...

107
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,976
positively predisposed toward me.

108
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,148
A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish
acting Lord of the Vale.

109
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,022
Titles do seem to breed titles.

110
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:14,278
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible
and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

111
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,449
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

112
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:19,127
of people who have taken up arms against him.

113
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:21,918
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

114
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:25,982
but Lord Baelish's absence
would present certain problems.

115
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:28,270
The royal wedding may end up

116
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:31,173
being the most expensive event in living memory.

117
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,346
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

118
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:38,214
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

119
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,416
Fully agreed.

120
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,733
Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.

121
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,488
Master of Coin?

122
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,416
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

123
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:50,126
I'm quite good at spending money,

124
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,128
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

125
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,065
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

126
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:57,378
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

127
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:59,269
Hear, hear.

128
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:02,544
* He lifted her high in the air *

129
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:04,775
* He sniffed and roared and smelled her there *

130
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:07,149
* She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair *

131
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,746
* But he licked the honey from her hair *

132
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:12,516
* From there to here, from here to there *

133
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,651
* All black and brown and covered with hair *

134
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:17,113
* He smelled that girl in the summer air *

135
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:20,237
* The bear, the bear and the maiden fair... *

136
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,059
I hope you're pleased.

137
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,224
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

138
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:27,235
You were armed when we were taken.

139
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:29,265
I was in chains if you recall.

140
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,173
Our little match would have ended quite quick
if my hands weren't bound.

141
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,505
All my life I've been hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

142
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,806
what a brilliant swordsman. "

143
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,543
You were slower than I expected.

144
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:43,312
And more predictable.

145
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,913
I've been sitting in a muddy pen

146
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,753
wrapped in chains for the past year.

147
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:49,121
And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.

148
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,601
You were not beating me.

149
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,389
Maybe you were as good as people said...

150
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,080
once.

151
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:59,305
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

152
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:05,179
When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped.

153
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,636
More than once.

154
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,997
None of these fellows have
ever been with a noblewoman.

155
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:13,858
You'd be wise not to resist.

156
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,846
- Would I?
- They'll knock your teeth out.

157
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,150
You think I care about my teeth?

158
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,537
No, I don't think you care about your teeth.

159
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:26,903
If you fight them, they will kill you.
Do you understand?

160
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,127
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

161
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:32,462
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

162
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:33,758
What does it matter?

163
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:36,533
Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.

164
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,836
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

165
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:43,135
You'd let them do what they wanted?

166
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:45,942
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.

167
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:48,344
But I'm not, thank the gods.

168
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,989
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

169
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,919
Doesn't have to look pretty.

170
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:59,681
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.

171
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,524
Why are you helping him?

172
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,868
He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
- You're not our

173
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,595
prisoner, little lady.

174
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,564
- What am I?
- Our guest.

175
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,972
No one's put any chains on you.

176
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,733
So I can walk away, then?

177
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:14,275
These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.

178
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:16,573
You're lucky we found you.

179
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:23,799
<i>You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?</i>

180
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,652
<i>Better than anyone you've ever met.</i>

181
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,616
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

182
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:29,785
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

183
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,021
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

184
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:35,626
Why? So you can kiss him?

185
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,639
You remember the last time you were here?

186
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,092
Looks like every other shit inn on the road.

187
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:43,968
Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker

188
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:46,204
and I'd rather not see you no more.

189
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,610
Watch your head.

190
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,365
<i>Off we go.
Walk up!</i>

191
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,669
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

192
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:05,549
I'm staying.

193
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:08,666
You're what?

194
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,729
I baked some brown bread for the innkeep

195
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,716
and she said she never had better.

196
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:15,384
Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment

197
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,082
for all the free meals she's given him.

198
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,377
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.

199
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:21,604
My brother ain't no king.

200
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:25,477
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.
- Winterfell.

201
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,074
You sure?

202
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,368
I'm sure.

203
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:33,163
Well, I made you something.

204
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,925
What is it?

205
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,299
It's a wolf.

206
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,354
Yes, it is.

207
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:50,844
That's the tail?

208
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:51,874
Yeah.

209
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,178
Well...

210
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:56,565
Be safe.

211
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,967
Yeah, you, too.

212
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,362
Don't get stabbed.

213
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,051
You don't...

214
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:04,963
burn your fingers.

215
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,998
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

216
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,454
Good-bye, Arry.

217
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,961
Up you go, little lady.

218
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,215
Hey, Hot Pie.

219
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:45,730
It's really good.

220
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:54,629
A person could almost be forgiven

221
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,708
for forgetting we're at war.

222
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:03,840
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

223
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,889
in most places in the world

224
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,471
absolutely nothing is happening.

225
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,240
I've missed you, Uncle.

226
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,240
Father missed you, too,

227
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,037
from the day you left.

228
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:20,232
Maybe he never said it in so many words...

229
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Maybe?

230
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:24,613
Your father was a stubborn old ox.

231
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,267
I was surprised when he died.

232
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:28,659
Didn't think death had the patience.

233
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:32,965
I'm glad you were with him.

234
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:37,327
I wish to the gods I had been.

235
00:17:38,354 --> 00:17:39,798
Did you make peace...

236
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,209
in the end?

237
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:43,700
After 30 years of fighting,

238
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:46,503
I don't think he remembered what started it.

239
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,641
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.

240
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,474
He said it was an old joke

241
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,690
and it was never funny to begin with.

242
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,957
I told him...

243
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,159
people had been calling me
Blackfish for so long,

244
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,739
they don't remember my real name.

245
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,499
Every time he would leave for the capital
or fight in a campaign,

246
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,862
I'd see him off.

247
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,725
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

248
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,137
"Wait for me

249
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:21,887
and I'll come back to you. "

250
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,110
And I would sit at this window
every day when the sun came up, waiting.

251
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:33,325
I wonder

252
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:38,301
how many times did Bran or Rickon
stare across the moors

253
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,103
of Winterfell waiting for me to return.

254
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:44,588
I will never see them again.

255
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,607
You mustn't think it.

256
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,264
We don't know the truth.

257
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:54,343
They could be in hiding.

258
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:00,277
Robb believes they're alive.

259
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:03,098
And he must go on believing.

260
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:06,706
He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.
And you...

261
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:09,470
must remain strong for him.

262
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,270
You're Robb Stark's wife.

263
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,344
Hold still.

264
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,871
Is it true what they say about him?

265
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:31,422
I don't know. What do they say about him?

266
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:34,613
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

267
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:36,906
True.

268
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,483
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

269
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:40,710
True.

270
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:45,916
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

271
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:54,153
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.

272
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:58,271
Unless it's a full moon.

273
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:00,384
It's not a full moon tonight, is it?

274
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,413
See?

275
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,868
Nothing to fear.

276
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,810
Always the artists.

277
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,312
It's only horses.

278
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,743
No men.

279
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,488
You said there was dead crows.

280
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,518
There was.

281
00:20:57,616 --> 00:20:59,306
How many men were here?

282
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,022
About 300.

283
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,436
And you know what those men are now?

284
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:11,295
We're all the same to them...
meat for their army.

285
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,972
Do you think anyone got away?

286
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:16,316
It's not impossible.

287
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,620
You don't go far betting against Mormont.

288
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,590
But dead or alive,

289
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,522
he took a big gamble coming north.

290
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:25,426
And he lost.

291
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:27,573
His best fighting men are dead.

292
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:31,331
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

293
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,488
or a blue-eyed corpse,

294
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:36,155
he's a long way from home.

295
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:38,052
Tormund.

296
00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:40,042
Climb the Wall.

297
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:43,265
Take Orell and 20 good men.

298
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:44,903
And take this one.

299
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,795
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better than any of us.

300
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:50,132
And if he's useful, good. If not...

301
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,171
throw him off the Wall.

302
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:54,529
See if crows can fly.

303
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,880
We're finally going to war, old friend?

304
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:02,753
Hide near Castle Black.
When I give the signal, hit them in the night.

305
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:05,445
They've got a big old wall to hide behind,

306
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,828
but it only guards one side.

307
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:10,715
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

308
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:13,065
If you do your job.

309
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:15,379
How will we see your signal?

310
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,884
Send your eagle above the Wall every night.

311
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:22,538
When it's time, I'm going to light
the biggest fire the North has ever seen.

312
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,063
Ghost?

313
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:06,618
What have we here?

314
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,422
Frozen crows?

315
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:10,401
We've come a long way.

316
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:15,781
Smaller flock than you went north with.

317
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:17,808
We can talk inside.

318
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,816
Can we?

319
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,270
Keep your eyes where they belong.

320
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,460
They're not for you.

321
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,331
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.

322
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:09,523
Aye.

323
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,448
Pig's got value to me.

324
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,113
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

325
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:20,229
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

326
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,252
You are a godly man?

327
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:23,262
I am.

328
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:26,430
I got no fear of what's out there.

329
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,092
When the white cold comes,

330
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:31,902
your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.

331
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,889
The only ones left will be those...

332
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,292
who are right with the gods.

333
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,105
The real gods.

334
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:48,654
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag
or she can bite down on my fist.

335
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,301
Women.

336
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,276
That sow right there gave birth
to a litter of...

337
00:24:58,843 --> 00:25:00,928
eight. Barely a grunt.

338
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,126
And she's almost as fat as this one here.

339
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:08,257
Now why don't you dine on him?

340
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:11,343
Carve off what you need as you go.

341
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:14,657
Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

342
00:25:55,608 --> 00:25:56,608
<i>Push.
That's it.</i>

343
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,733
You're nearly there.

344
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,950
One more push should do it.

345
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:19,811
What is it? What is it?

346
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,150
Keep quiet.

347
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:24,605
If you can't ride,

348
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:26,165
we don't stand a chance.

349
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:27,635
I can ride.

350
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:29,427
You're sure?

351
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,250
Ride east.

352
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,430
Follow the rising sun.

353
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,072
Your sister's waiting for you.

354
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,211
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

355
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:53,245
We're not in the Iron Islands.

356
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:54,275
Go.

357
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,425
Come on.

358
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:10,518
You refuse to tell me where you're going?

359
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:13,168
I don't know yet. The fires will show me.

360
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,018
How long will you be gone?

361
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,152
I don't know.

362
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:19,237
You're abandoning me.

363
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,947
I will never abandon you.

364
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,052
You are the Son of Fire.

365
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:27,831
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

366
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:30,093
When I return, you will understand.

367
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,243
My enemies think they've destroyed me.

368
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,455
They're laughing at me

369
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:41,157
the way Renly laughed at me.

370
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,040
I want Joffrey dead.

371
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,148
I want Robb Stark dead.

372
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:52,774
Make me another son.

373
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,007
I cannot.

374
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:56,332
Why?

375
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:58,107
You don't have the strength.

376
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,235
It would kill you.

377
00:28:59,265 --> 00:29:02,465
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

378
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,013
I want you.

379
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:24,619
Your fires burn low, my king.

380
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,187
There is another way. A better way.

381
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:35,033
You told me your magic requires a king's blood.

382
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:36,783
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

383
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:37,793
You are.

384
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:41,408
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

385
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,531
You will sit on the Iron Throne,

386
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:48,262
but first there must be sacrifices.

387
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:50,190
The Lord of Light demands it.

388
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:04,716
The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.

389
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:05,746
To whom?

390
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:09,792
To any slave who contemplates doing
whatever these slaves did.

391
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,027
Give me your water.

392
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:14,318
Khaleesi.

393
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:17,043
This man has been sentenced to death.

394
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:23,843
Here, drink.

395
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,315
Leave this place, Your Grace.

396
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:31,755
Leave tonight, I beg you.

397
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,532
And what is she to do for soldiers?

398
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:35,919
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

399
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,459
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

400
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:43,624
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

401
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:46,156
That will mean blood on your
hands before the thing is done.

402
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,853
The blood of my enemies,

403
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:49,242
not the blood of innocents.

404
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:54,725
How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

405
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:55,755
Three.

406
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,828
Have you ever seen a war
where innocents didn't die by the thousands?

407
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:07,227
I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi.

408
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:10,235
You know what I saw? Butchery.

409
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:11,785
Babies, children...

410
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:14,939
old men.
More women raped than you can count.

411
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:16,896
There's a beast in every man

412
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,498
and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

413
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:22,437
But the Unsullied are not men.

414
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,613
They do not rape.

415
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:26,927
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

416
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:28,187
If you buy them...

417
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:31,515
the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

418
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:33,163
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

419
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:36,714
When your brother Rhaegar led
his army into battle at the Trident,

420
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:40,398
men died for him because they believed in him,
because they loved him,

421
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:44,294
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

422
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,229
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

423
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:50,943
I bled beside him.

424
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,633
Rhaegar fought valiantly...

425
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:55,768
Rhaegar fought nobly...

426
00:31:55,972 --> 00:31:57,222
and Rhaegar died.

427
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:00,689
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

428
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,849
I did, Your Grace.

429
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,967
Finest man I ever met.

430
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:06,584
I wish I had known him.

431
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,609
But he was not the last dragon.

432
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:21,684
<i>All?</i>

433
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:24,335
Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?

434
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,728
They did not. I want to buy them all.

435
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,657
There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.

436
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:47,040
Is this what you mean by all?

437
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,753
Yes. 8,000.

438
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:51,403
And the ones still in training as well.

439
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:04,160
Master Greizhen says they
cannot sell half-trained boys.

440
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:08,361
If they fail on the battlefield,
they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

441
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:09,940
I will have them all or take none.

442
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:14,034
Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys
to pick up the swords they drop.

443
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,199
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.

444
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:29,601
<i>Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.</i>

445
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:33,702
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

446
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,530
<i>The gold you have left</i>

447
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,280
is worth 10.

448
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,788
<i>But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.</i>

449
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:46,368
<i>The Dothraki you have with you...</i>

450
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:54,150
The Dothraki you have are not
worth what they cost to feed,

451
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,116
<i>but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied</i>

452
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:58,603
for all of them.

453
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,214
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay for the remaining

454
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:08,190
7,877 Unsullied.

455
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:15,152
I have dragons.

456
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:16,849
I'll give you one.

457
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:23,476
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

458
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:25,263
Khaleesi, please.

459
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,692
Three dragons.

460
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:38,021
- One.
- Two.

461
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:39,051
One.

462
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,008
They want the biggest one.

463
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,128
- Done.
- Done.

464
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,912
I'll take you as well, now.

465
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:05,145
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.

466
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:07,717
A token of a bargain well struck.

467
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,731
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.

468
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,348
Aegon Targaryen proved that.

469
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,756
You're both here to advise me.

470
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:30,715
I value your advice, but if you ever question me
in front of strangers again,

471
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:32,900
you'll be advising someone else.

472
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:34,522
Is that understood?

473
00:35:38,284 --> 00:35:39,734
Do you have a name?

474
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:42,656
This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.

475
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:46,861
Do you have a family? A mother and a father
you'd return to if you had the choice?

476
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:49,507
No, Your Grace. No family living.

477
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:53,356
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

478
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,003
Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.

479
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,344
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

480
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:03,546
I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the
Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me?

481
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:04,927
"Let me die. "

482
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,085
There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.

483
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:13,340
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me
about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

484
00:36:13,897 --> 00:36:16,203
All questions have been taken from them.

485
00:36:16,368 --> 00:36:18,448
They obey, that is all.

486
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:20,795
Once they are yours, they are yours.

487
00:36:21,152 --> 00:36:23,840
They will fall on their swords if you command it.

488
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,240
And what about you?

489
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,991
You know that I'm taking you to war.
You may go hungry.

490
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:30,764
You may fall sick.

491
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,784
You may be killed.

492
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:35,217
Valar morghulis.

493
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,273
Yes, all men must die.

494
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:41,381
But we are not men.

495
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,953
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.

496
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,731
I'm surprised you're surprised.

497
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,629
This is the safest place in the city.

498
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,484
Not for bastards.

499
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,323
- That's all of them, my lord.
- Thank you, my dear.

500
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:14,971
Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

501
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,142
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

502
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,494
Only my life.

503
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:35,053
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.
You should have him knighted.

504
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:38,883
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

505
00:37:39,581 --> 00:37:41,684
If only.

506
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,768
I owe you a significant debt. Our...

507
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,315
redheaded friend.

508
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:51,318
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

509
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:52,805
Oh, that.

510
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,184
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

511
00:37:56,214 --> 00:38:00,183
Apparently, Her Grace believed
that you two had some sort of...

512
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:02,008
special relationship.

513
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:03,598
We don't.

514
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,196
I did fuck her once.
- I know.

515
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,442
- But we don't.
- I know.

516
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,336
But how would the queen get that idea?

517
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,154
Why don't you ask her?

518
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,086
Any advice for me on my new position?

519
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:20,851
Keep a low profile.

520
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:24,647
If I had a gold dragon

521
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:28,368
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

522
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:30,452
Well, you are richer than I am.

523
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:31,852
Good point.

524
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,448
They're only numbers.

525
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,602
Numbers on paper. Once you understand that,
it's...

526
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:39,089
easy to make them behave.

527
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:40,736
Trivial even.

528
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:42,483
You want a real challenge?

529
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,956
Try whores.
- I've tried quite a few.

530
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:49,080
Well, lots of work to do.

531
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,653
Enjoy the Eyrie.

532
00:38:51,926 --> 00:38:53,433
<i>Come on, I'm here later.</i>

533
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:00,486
Tonight, then.

534
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,922
- Looks like dull reading.
- You think all reading is dull reading.

535
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:09,975
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

536
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:13,083
The secret history of the Seven
Kingdoms is written in these pages.

537
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:15,361
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers

538
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:16,985
to hide what he's really up to.

539
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:19,027
Unless he made it all up, yes.

540
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,471
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

541
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,822
Yes, my lord?

542
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:27,138
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

543
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:30,472
I finally found a suitable reward
for the services you've provided

544
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:33,573
over and above
what might be considered reasonable.

545
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:34,812
Tell me, Pod,

546
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:38,415
have you ever been with a woman?

547
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:39,862
No, my lord.

548
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:41,146
Wonderful.

549
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,163
...specializes in first-timers.

550
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,376
She's not bad with second-timers, either.

551
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:50,955
My lord...

552
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,667
A fair enough repayment for putting your spear
through my would-be killer's face,

553
00:39:54,697 --> 00:39:55,801
wouldn't you say?

554
00:39:57,746 --> 00:39:58,746
Now...

555
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:00,315
as it happens,

556
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:02,673
Marei...

557
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,566
is quite the spear handler herself.

558
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:10,073
She's here to thank you for staying by my side

559
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:13,126
as the battle raged all around me.

560
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,601
He's handsome.

561
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:18,307
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

562
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,084
Kayla...

563
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,906
is famous from here to Volantis

564
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:25,321
in certain circles.

565
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,863
One of four women in the world

566
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:30,870
who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

567
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:34,494
My lord, I don't even...

568
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:38,876
She's here to thank you
for being a thoroughly respectful fellow

569
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:42,282
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord. "

570
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:47,353
Be back in time for my supper.

571
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,519
Pace yourself, lad.

572
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,843
For years I've heard that Littlefinger
is a magician.

573
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:03,037
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together and...

574
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,012
mountains of gold.

575
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:07,580
Let me guess. He's not a magician.

576
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,610
No.

577
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:13,828
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

578
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,659
What's wrong with that?

579
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:20,017
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

580
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:22,445
The crown owes millions to my father.

581
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:24,943
Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne,

582
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:27,082
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

583
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,374
Forgive a debt, my father?

584
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,987
For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.

585
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:34,236
I've never borrowed money before.

586
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,984
I'm not clear on the rules.
Well...

587
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,054
The basic principle is

588
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,027
I lend you money,
and after an agreed upon period of time,

589
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:50,723
you return it with interest.

590
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:52,860
And what if I don't?

591
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:54,695
Well, you have to.

592
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:56,242
But what if I don't?

593
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,871
This is why I don't lend you money.

594
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,825
Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.

595
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,747
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

596
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:05,887
We owe them tens of millions.

597
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,707
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

598
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:13,431
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

599
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,090
The return of the conquering hero.

600
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,046
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

601
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:22,205
The lad's practically skipping.

602
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:25,885
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.

603
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:27,604
Or should I say my money's worth?

604
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:32,049
It was a gift, Podrick.

605
00:42:32,478 --> 00:42:34,235
This is more than I give you in a year.

606
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:36,345
He's a squire. You don't pay him.

607
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,129
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

608
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,905
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

609
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:45,867
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor
with the new Master of Coin.

610
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,450
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?

611
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,086
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

612
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:52,566
What did you tell them?

613
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:56,128
- I didn't tell them anything.
- What did you do to them?

614
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,775
- Lots of things.
- And they seemed to like these things?

615
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:01,138
Yes, my lord.

616
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:03,856
Of course they seemed to like it.
They're paid to seem to like it.

617
00:43:03,886 --> 00:43:05,734
Only they weren't paid.

618
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,633
What are you saying?

619
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:11,549
These ladies enjoyed him so much,
they gave him the time for free?

620
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,831
Is that what you're telling us?

621
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,545
Sit down, Podrick.

622
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,796
We're going to need details.

623
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:30,186
Copious details.

624
00:44:10,878 --> 00:44:12,464
Come on! Come on!

625
00:45:45,854 --> 00:45:48,528
You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?

626
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:56,960
Take off his pants.

627
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:57,990
No!

628
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,212
No! No!

629
00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:04,095
I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

630
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:05,622
No, please! No, no, no!

631
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,352
No, don't!

632
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,859
No, please!

633
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,100
No!

634
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,561
You little bastard.

635
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:57,112
Come, my lord.

636
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,033
You're a long way from home...

637
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:03,404
and winter is coming.

638
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:31,574
I'll take the big bitch first.

639
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:33,365
When she's good and wet...

640
00:47:33,494 --> 00:47:35,019
you lot can finish her off.

641
00:47:35,258 --> 00:47:37,524
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.

642
00:47:38,113 --> 00:47:42,268
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me
to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.

643
00:47:42,298 --> 00:47:44,451
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.

644
00:47:45,018 --> 00:47:48,997
Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.
Nobody said shit about you.

645
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:55,776
You're only making it worse.

646
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,528
Take her over there where it's dark.

647
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:04,232
I'd like a little privacy.

648
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,996
You know who she is, don't you?

649
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,484
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.

650
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,455
Never been with a woman that big.

651
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:32,855
She's Brienne of Tarth.

652
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:35,869
Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

653
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:39,269
Heard of Tarth?

654
00:48:41,424 --> 00:48:44,011
They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?

655
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:48,801
Every sapphire in Westeros
was mined on Tarth.

656
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,363
Sapphires are gemstones.

657
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:55,209
- The blue ones.
- I know what they are.

658
00:48:57,076 --> 00:49:01,369
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight
in sapphires if she's returned to him.

659
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,398
But only if she's alive,

660
00:49:05,582 --> 00:49:08,081
her honor unbesmirched.

661
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,253
Bring her back here.

662
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:22,459
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

663
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:30,099
Unbesmirched.

664
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:34,314
Not defiled.

665
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,788
Fancy word for a fancy man.

666
00:49:38,731 --> 00:49:40,371
I hated to read as a child,

667
00:49:40,983 --> 00:49:43,715
but my father forced me
to study the books every morning

668
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:46,593
before I could practice with sword or horse.

669
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:50,945
Two hours every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

670
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,471
I learned a lot of fancy words.

671
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:55,441
I bet you did.

672
00:50:04,477 --> 00:50:05,499
Your father,

673
00:50:06,914 --> 00:50:09,173
he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?

674
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:13,844
You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.

675
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:17,353
And your sons will be rich men
and their sons after them.

676
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:18,927
Lands...

677
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:20,202
Titles...

678
00:50:20,841 --> 00:50:21,863
you'll have them all.

679
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,879
The North can't win this war.

680
00:50:28,052 --> 00:50:30,220
You're a smart man. You understand that.

681
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,011
We have the numbers. We have the gold.

682
00:50:33,084 --> 00:50:34,106
You have both.

683
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,550
Fighting bravely for a losing cause
is admirable.

684
00:50:40,802 --> 00:50:42,510
Fighting for a winning cause is...

685
00:50:43,466 --> 00:50:45,140
far more rewarding.

686
00:50:46,414 --> 00:50:47,780
Hard to argue with that.

687
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:54,297
Now that we're speaking together man to man,

688
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:55,589
I wonder...

689
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,980
if you need
to keep me chained to this tree.

690
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,708
I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints,

691
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,179
but if I could sleep lying down,

692
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:07,214
my back would thank you for it.

693
00:51:07,545 --> 00:51:10,132
I'm not as young
and resilient as I was once.

694
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:13,195
None of us are.

695
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:18,016
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

696
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,373
<i>Come on, men.</i>

697
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,456
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

698
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,088
I'm famished, actually.

699
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,091
I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.

700
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:36,044
Well, I do like partridge.

701
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:44,159
Bring the bird over here.

702
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,477
And the carving knife.

703
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,062
Will this work as a table, my lord?

704
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,689
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic...

705
00:51:56,272 --> 00:51:57,752
On the stump.

706
00:52:04,115 --> 00:52:07,810
You think you're the smartest man there is.

707
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:14,199
That everyone alive has to bow and scrape
and lick your boots.

708
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,347
- My father...
- And if you get in any trouble,

709
00:52:17,377 --> 00:52:20,131
all you've got to do is say "my father"

710
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:23,765
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

711
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:27,777
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say?

712
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:36,474
Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing.

713
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:41,973
You're nothing without your daddy,

714
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:44,286
and your daddy ain't here.

715
00:52:45,426 --> 00:52:48,036
Never forget that.

716
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:52,089
Here, this should help you remember.

717
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:04,986
<i>*There there was, a bear, a bear.
All black an brown and covered with hair*</i>

718
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:09,597
<i>* Three boys, a goat, and a dancing bear *</i>

719
00:53:09,631 --> 00:53:13,401
<i>* They danced and spun right to the fair *</i>

720
00:53:13,435 --> 00:53:16,971
<i>* How sweet she was, so pure and fair *</i>

721
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:20,708
<i>* The maid with honey up in her hair *</i>

722
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:24,245
<i>* He smelled her all in the summer air *</i>

723
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:27,281
<i>* The maid with honey up in her hair *</i>

724
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:31,252
<i>* From there to here, from here to there *</i>

725
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:34,956
<i>* All black and brown and covered in hair *</i>

726
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,192
<i>* He smelled that girl in the summer air *</i>

727
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:41,796
<i>- * The bear, the bear *
- * The maiden fair *</i>

728
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:46,267
<i>* Oh, I'm a maid and I'm pure and fair *</i>

729
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:49,871
<i>* I'll never dance with a hairy bear *</i>

730
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:53,641
<i>* I called a knight, but you're a bear *</i>

731
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:56,710
<i>* All black and brown and covered in hair *</i>

732
00:53:56,745 --> 00:54:00,448
<i>* From there to here, from here to there *</i>

733
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:04,219
<i>* All black and brown and covered in hair *</i>

734
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:07,522
<i>* He smelled that girl in the summer air *</i>

735
00:54:07,557 --> 00:54:12,194
<i>- * The bear, the bear *
- * The maiden fair. *</i>

736
