1
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:02,215
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:06,406
Your father has named Lord Tyrion
to serve as Hand in his stead.

3
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:07,873
You brought this on yourself.

4
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:08,959
I've done nothing.

5
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:11,429
Do you understand we're losing the war?

6
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,753
Is it ever end?

7
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:14,768
<i>Everything ends,
even the Red Waste.</i>

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,236
<i>Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

9
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,934
Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us,

10
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,624
and what lies on the other side.

11
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:25,475
<i>All the other wildlings for 100 leagues,</i>
has disappeared.

12
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,813
<i>Craster's still here.</i>

13
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:30,950
Any man lays a hand on one
of my wives, he loses the hand.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,239
<i>He marries his daughters, 
and they give him more daughters.</i>

15
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:36,724
What happens to the boys?
What does he do with his sons?

16
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,906
<i>"My brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,</i>

17
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:42,136
the boy Joffrey being born of incest
between Cersei Lannister

18
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,691
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

19
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,091
By right of birth and blood,

20
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,584
<i>I do this day lay claim to the
Iron Throne of Westeros."</i>

21
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,998
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm.

22
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:53,244
<i>I'm sending one of your cousins down 
to King's Landing with my peace terms.</i>

23
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:55,399
You think my father's going to negotiate with you?

24
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:56,799
You don't know him very well.

25
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:59,178
We won't beat them until,
you take King's Landing.

26
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,324
We can't take King's Landing without ships.

27
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,930
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail.

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,140
- Men who fought my father.
- I'm his only living son.

29
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,563
He'll listen to me.

30
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:10,832
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

31
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,417
- I need his ships.
- He is not trustworthy.

32
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:16,446
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime and you.

33
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,960
Father had other children?

34
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,345
What are you asking?

35
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,861
<i>How many bastards does
he have running around?</i>

36
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,670
Where is the bastard?

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,547

<i>Put a watch on the ridge.</i>

<i>Along the tree-rows.</i>

45
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,626
Boy.

46
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,227
Lovely boy.

47
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,106
What do you want?

48
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,358
A man has a thirst.

49
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,005
The man does not drink for a day and a night.

50
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,511
A boy could make a friend.

51
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,955
I have friends.

52
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,930
Give us a beer, before I skin you.

53
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:16,164
A man does not choose his companions.

54
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,341
These two, they have no courtesy.

55
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,247
A man must ask forgiveness.

56
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,250
You're called Arry.

57
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,486
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.
Once of the Free City of Lorath.

58
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,321
Hey, you little shit.

59
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,149
Get us beer!

60
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,058
You should have asked nicely.

61
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,463
Come closer.

62
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,673
And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole

63
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,669
and fuck you bloody.

64
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,805
The boy has more courage than sense.

65
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:52,872
Come here!

66
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:56,404
Yoren said none of us were
should go near of those three.

67
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:57,761
They don't scare me.

68
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,734
Then you're stupid.

69
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,114
They scare me.

70
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:09,266
Would a gold collector look
this far from King's Landing?

71
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,442
- What are you doing?
- They're looking for me.

72
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,730
You're in command here?

73
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,020
You're a long way from home.

74
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,898
I asked you a question.

75
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,512
<i>Aye,</i> you did.

76
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:29,594
You asked without manners.

77
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,791
And I chose not to answer.

78
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,650
I have a royal warrant.

79
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,872
For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.

80
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:42,648
Well the thing is,

81
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:47,618
these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now.

82
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:50,576
That puts them beyond the
reach of kings and queens.

83
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:51,846
Off with his...

84
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,137
It's a funny thing.

85
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:59,027
People worry so much about their throats,
they forget about what's down low.

86
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:03,628
Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast.

87
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,387
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.

88
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,730
Or,

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,253
I could nick this artery in your leg,

90
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:13,697
and once it's nicked,

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,027
there's no one around here who
knows how to un-nick it.

92
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,507
We'll just keep that.

93
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:25,355
Good steel is always needed on the wall.

94
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:27,949
Seems you have a choice.

95
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,159
You can die here at this
crossroads a long way from home.

96
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,044
Or you can go back to your city and

97
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:37,618
tell your masters you didn't find
what you were looking for.

98
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,224
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

99
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,963
He carries a bull's head helmet.

100
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:51,523
Anyone turning him over,

101
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,751
will earn the King's reward.

102
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,341
We'll be back.
With more men.

103
00:06:56,805 --> 00:07:00,349
And I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

104
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,338
My lord.

105
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:41,434
You make me wait a long time.
And your friend keeps me company.

106
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,756
We were just speaking of your bravery,

107
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,029
in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.

108
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,696
It was quite a battle.

109
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:53,638
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

110
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:57,271
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

111
00:07:57,514 --> 00:08:00,275
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

112
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:04,982
To find such a lovely creature
working in your father's kitchen.

113
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:07,344
It almost beggars belief.

114
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:10,207
Strange things do happen.

115
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,037
You should taste her fish pie.

116
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,656
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

117
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,107
How can you tell?

118
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:20,245
- I can always tell.
- Men like Lord Varys and I,

119
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:23,005
can't let our disadvantages get the best of us.

120
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,241
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

121
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:29,960
I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

122
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:33,711
Friends are such an important part of life.

123
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,849
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

124
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,926
But rest easy my lord,

125
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:44,256
I am very good at keeping
secrets for my good friends.

126
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:47,316
Your discretion is legendary,

127
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:50,790
- where your friends are concerned.
- How unspeakable of me,

128
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,032
to go on and on,
when all you want to do is rest.

129
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,345
I will leave you.

130
00:08:57,557 --> 00:08:59,710
Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.

131
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:02,592
The city is made brighter by your presence.

132
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,760
We have a council meeting, my lord.

133
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,482
I don't like threats.

134
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:12,210
Who threatened you?

135
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,315
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

136
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:18,213
- Ned Stark was a man of honor.
- And I am not.

137
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:21,352
Threaten me again and I will
have you thrown into the sea.

138
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:27,454
You might be disappointed in the results.

139
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,308
The storms come and go.

140
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:35,035
The big fish eat the little fish.
And I keep on paddling.

141
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,586
Come, my lord.

142
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,947
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

143
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,528
From this time until the end of time,
we are not part of your realm,

144
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,710
but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.

145
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,596
He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.

146
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:04,163
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.

147
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:08,227
Give him his father's bones back,
at least as a gesture of good faith.

148
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,964
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

149
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,666
I will, Your Grace.

150
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,729
Did you see my brother when
you were the Starks guest?

151
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,759
I did.

152
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:21,142
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

153
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,640
If you speak with him,

154
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,786
tell him he's not been forgotten.

155
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:28,914
I will, Your Grace.

156
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,358
Safe travels, cousin.

157
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,832
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

158
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,237
If that's everything?

159
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:43,101
A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.

160
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,372
Trouble with the wildlings?

161
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,936
That's why they're called wildlings.

162
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,422
Somewhat less wild these days.

163
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,380
It seems they've stopped killing each
other and started following this

164
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,763
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

165
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:56,846
Another king?

166
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:59,869
How many is that now?
Five? I've lost count.

167
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,915
Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man The Wall.

168
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:07,449
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

169
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,414
Cold winds are rising,

170
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,775
and the dead rise with them.

171
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,182
The northerners are a superstitious people.

172
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:20,126
According to the Commander, one of these
dead men attacked him in his chambers.

173
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:21,830
Mormont doesn't lie.

174
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,338
How do you kill a dead man?

175
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,559
Apparently you burn him.

176
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,896
One trip to The Wall and
you come back believing in

177
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:34,296
grumpkins and snarks.

178
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:36,662
I don't know what I believe,

179
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,868
but here's a fact for you.

180
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,446
The Night's Watch is the
only thing that separates us

181
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:45,783
- from what lies beyond the Wall.
- I have every confidence,

182
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:49,487
to the brave men of the
Night's Watch will protect us all.

183
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,173
<i>Night, sir.</i>

184
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:54,317
The gods wanted us to have dignity,

185
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,891
wouldn't make us fart when we died.

186
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,809
We fart when we die?

187
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,783
My blessed mother,

188
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:05,703
was holding her own when she left this world.

189
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:08,755
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

190
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,339
Seems a bit greedy for one
man to have so many wives.

191
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,719
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

192
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:26,302
We were having a serious discussion.

193
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:29,792
Would you look at that.

194
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,558
Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.

195
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,219
I prefer watching them come towards me.

196
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:39,345
I'm sure that's nice too.

197
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,025
Well, there was a milkmaid

198
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,340
named Violet on the next farm
over from where I grew up.

199
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,570
And we were wrestling together from
the time we were six years old.

200
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,607
And then we got older,

201
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,855
the wrestling...

202
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:55,751
changed.

203
00:12:56,556 --> 00:12:58,187
You were with her?

204
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,052
How many times?

205
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,352
Well, as many times as I could.

206
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,344
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.

207
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:10,005
We need more potatoes.

208
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,378
I'll get another sack for the sludge.

209
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:17,691
Get the turnips too.

210
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:30,733
No.

211
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,284
Ghost, no!

212
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,259
No.

213
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:36,907
Ghost, away.

214
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,430
You all right?

215
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:47,548
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

216
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:50,931
Right.

217
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

218
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,315
You're very brave.

219
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:15,026
What's he doing?

220
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:16,969
This is Gilly,

221
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:19,531
she's one of Craster's daughters.

222
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,594
Hello, Gilly.
What's he doing?

223
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:23,932
Sam said you could help.

224
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:27,262
- I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...
- She's pregnant.

225
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:36,796
We have to take her with us,
when we leave.

226
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:37,826
What?

227
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:40,456
I know it sounds a bit mad.

228
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:42,877
No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
The Lord Commander...

229
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:44,462
We are sworn to protect.

230
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,081
- Sam we can't take her.
- Please sir, please.

231
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:50,275
- I can still run if I have to.
- It's just not possible.

232
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,066
I'm going to have a baby,
if it's a boy I...

233
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,148
If it's a boy, what?

234
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,107
You want us to risk our lives for you,

235
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,246
and you won't even tell us why.

236
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,972
- Why did you do that?
- Do what, ask her a question?

237
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,894
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?!

238
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,881
- Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
- I didn't touch her!

239
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:20,449
No you just want to steal her,

240
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,632
- what do you think Craster cuts off for that?
- I can't steal her,

241
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,140
she's a person not a goat.

242
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,501
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

243
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,370
We can't take a girl with us.

244
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,904
Mormont wouldn't have it.
And even if he would,

245
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:40,434
what would we do with her?

246
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,806
Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

247
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:45,168
I could try...

248
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,092
What? I've read about it.

249
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:50,734
A bit.

250
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:53,952
I'm sorry Sam,

251
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,642
we can't help her.

252
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:54,389
Khaleesi.

253
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:43,763
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

254
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,562
Who did this?

255
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,127
Khal Pono perhaps,

256
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,194
Khal Jhaqo...

257
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,481
They don't like the idea of a
woman leading a Khalasaar.

258
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:57,533
They will like it far less
when I'm done with them.

259
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,720
<b>They killed his soul!</b>

260
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,642
<b>They cannot kill his soul.</b>

261
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:17,873
<b>They did.</b>

262
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,351
<b>They butchered him like an animal.</b>

263
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:24,155
<b>They did not burn his body.</b>

264
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,947
<b>He can never join his ancestors
in the night lands.</b>

265
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:32,353
<b>We will build him a...</b>

266
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,373
<b> funeral pyre.</b>

267
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:41,305
<b>And I promise you,</b>

268
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,617
<b>Rakharo will ride with his
ancestors tonight.</b>

269
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,179
Is it as you remember my lord?

270
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,332
Looks smaller.

271
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,785
Everything looks bigger when you're a child.

272
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:40,565
I remember my father's cabin,
felt like a palace when I was little.

273
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,018
Now look at it...

274
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,591
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

275
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,628
Who will?

276
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:49,245
Anyone who matters,

277
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,669
this is a big day for them.

278
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,634
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

279
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,594
It's a hard place the Iron Islands...
Always has been.

280
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:01,035
It's cold and it's wet.

281
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,896
I love the cold and wet.

282
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:05,861
They say hard places breed hard men,

283
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:09,946
and hard men rule the world.

284
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:13,924
Then you'll be king before long.

285
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,168
Try smiling with your lips closed.

286
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:22,043
Better.

287
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:27,345
My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

288
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,436
I don't blame him.

289
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:32,449
He says that you're all reavers and rapers.

290
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:36,298
And that no matter how many women you have,
you'll never be satis...

291
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:38,784
Quit talking about your father.

292
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,965
He's right about us.

293
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,878
Our wives from the Iron Islands,

294
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,173
they're for breeding.
That's not enough for us.

295
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:51,340
That's why we take saltwives,

296
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,218
women we capture.

297
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,642
Capture me!
Take me with you when you go ashore.

298
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,561
- Make me your saltwife.
- Your place is on this ship.

299
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,830
Not after you leave.

300
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,635
Father will punish me.

301
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,003
He'll call me a whore.

302
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,705
I haven't paid you.

303
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:50,975
I barely touched her.

304
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,542
And you charge twice as much
as every other brothel.

305
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:54,951
And this is what I get, crying?

306
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,308
One moment, my friend.
A moment.

307
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,297
Please accept my sincerest apologies.
Ramka will take good care of you.

308
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,288
Sorry my lord.

309
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,614
Did he hurt you?

310
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:51,678
No, my lord.

311
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:55,642
It's Megan.

312
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,990
Who?

313
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:00,352
She works for you.

314
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:03,493
She's the one,

315
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:05,728
the girl whose,

316
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:08,127
- they killed her baby.
- Yes,

317
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,041
that was...

318
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,805
poorly handled.

319
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:18,345
Sometimes those with the
most power have the least grace.

320
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,455
Can't stop thinking about it,

321
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,008
I can't sleep.

322
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,414
Her poor little baby.

323
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,298
You know you remind me of another girl?

324
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:36,516
A lovely thing I once acquired
from an Elysium pleasure house.

325
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,533
Beautiful,

326
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:42,549
like yourself, and intelligent,

327
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,133
like yourself.

328
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,719
But she wasn't happy.

329
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:50,891
She cried, often.

330
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,842
I asked her why but,

331
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:58,732
we didn't have the kind of
rapport that you and I have.

332
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,047
Yes, it was quite sad.

333
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,316
Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive.

334
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:11,090
Extremely expensive.

335
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:15,589
And this one wasn't making me any money.

336
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,366
I hate bad investments.

337
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,213
Really, I do.

338
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,235
They haunt me.

339
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,758
I had no idea how to make her happy,

340
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:37,393
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

341
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:43,458
A very wealthy patron, he offered me
a tremendous amount of money to let him

342
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:48,065
transform this lovely, sad girl.

343
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:51,067
To use her in ways that,

344
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:53,734
never occur to most men.

345
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:59,063
And you know what occurs to most men.

346
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,114
I wouldn't say he succeeded in making her happy,

347
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:08,476
but my losses,

348
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:11,318
were definitely mitigated.

349
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,634
Take tonight off.
Tomorrow, Megan's child...

350
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,797
Will see you tomorrow.

351
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:27,690
Better be happy.

352
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,196
That makes me happy.

353
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:46,872
<i>More wine?</i>

354
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:50,414
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.

355
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,555
Leave us, Podrik.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

356
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:56,820
Is that your new squire?

357
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,674
Could have found you a proper lad.

358
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:01,281
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

359
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,148
That's a good red.
Dornish?

360
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:07,179
- You know your wines, my lord.
- That I do.

361
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,603
- A fine dinner, my lord.
- Call me Tyrion, please.

362
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:15,726
I'm sure you're getting used to
fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

363
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,619
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

364
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,355
Wars have been started for less.

365
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:25,307
I heard there was some trouble
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

366
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:28,936
- Nasty business, had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

367
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:30,998
City Watch must keep the peace.

368
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:32,157
Only,

369
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:36,040
I hadn't realized peace
depended on killing babies.

370
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,482
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

371
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,769
Especially the queen's orders.

372
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:42,578
I never said they were the queen's orders.

373
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:43,754
No, but...

374
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:46,856
Who else would want to
murder King Robert's bastards?

375
00:26:47,236 --> 00:26:48,862
She's always been a jealous woman.

376
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:50,439
You know your sister better than I do.

377
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:52,977
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister.

378
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:54,458
I don't listen to filth.

379
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,372
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

380
00:26:58,114 --> 00:26:59,956
I suppose people who do believe that filth,

381
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,186
consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants

382
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:03,550
to the throne than Cersei's children.

383
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,722
Joffrey is my king,
the rest doesn't interest me.

384
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:07,387
I appreciate your loyalty.

385
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,461
Tell me.

386
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:14,608
When your men slaughtered
Ned Stark's men in the throne room,

387
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:16,619
did you give the order?

388
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:18,639
I did.

389
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,573
And I would again.

390
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:22,914
The man was a traitor.

391
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:24,936
He tried to buy my loyalty.

392
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,385
The fool.

393
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:29,783
He had no idea you were already bought.

394
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,324
Are you drunk?

395
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:34,323
I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.

396
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,333
I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.

397
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,391
I'm denying its existence.

398
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:42,647
You think I'll stand here and
take this from you, dwarf.

399
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:43,758
Dwarf?

400
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:45,639
You should have stopped at imp.

401
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:48,132
And yes, you will stand here and take it from me,

402
00:27:48,162 --> 00:27:51,228
unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.

403
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:54,974
I intend to serve as Hand of the King
until my father returns from the war

404
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:58,765
and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of
the King, well I just wouldn't feel safe

405
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,365
with you lurking about.

406
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:01,438
What are you…

407
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,752
My friends at court will not allow this.

408
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,137
- The queen herself...
- The queen regent.

409
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,667
And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.

410
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:10,891
We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.

411
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,237
No, we shan't.

412
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:22,735
There's a ship leaving for
East Watch by the Sea tonight.

413
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:26,360
From there, I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

414
00:28:26,947 --> 00:28:28,752
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

415
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,299
I found it surprisingly beautiful,

416
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:32,942
in a brutal,

417
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,416
horribly uncomfortable sort of way.

418
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,031
The lads will escort you.

419
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,224
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

420
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:41,537
These men are under my command.

421
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:43,792
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

422
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,322
His name is Bronn...

423
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,402
And he is the new commander of the City Watch.

424
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,080
Boys.

425
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,939
I have friends at court.

426
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,864
Powerful friends.

427
00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:59,258
The king himself made me a lord.

428
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:05,763
To the new Commander.

429
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,405
If I told you to murder,

430
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:18,873
an infant girl say,
still at her mother's breast...

431
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:22,170
Would you do it without question?

432
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,318
Without question?
No.

433
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:29,740
I'd ask how much.

434
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,865
If they come back, I say we yield.

435
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,439
Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to
get caught in the middle of a battle.

436
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:53,994
I'm not afraid of no battles.

437
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:56,889
If you got within a mile of a
battle, you'd fill your pants.

438
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,461
I've seen lots of battles.

439
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:00,059
- I saw...
- Liar.

440
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:04,557
I saw a man kill another man just
outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

441
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:06,604
Stabbed him right in the neck.

442
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:09,719
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

443
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:11,619
They had armor on.

444
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:13,087
So?

445
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:15,306
So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.

446
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:16,675
No, it isn't.

447
00:30:17,308 --> 00:30:19,891
What's a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

448
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,117
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

449
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:25,698
Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.

450
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,511
It's when they've got armor on.

451
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,904
I already told you that.

452
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,886
A knight?

453
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,304
How'd you know he was a knight?

454
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:40,363
Well, cause they got armor on.

455
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:44,979
You don't have to be a knight to have armor.
Any idiot can buy armor.

456
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,457
How'd you know?

457
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:48,901
Cause I sold armor.

458
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,550
What do the gold-clips want with you?

459
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,925
No idea.

460
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:05,958
You're a liar.

461
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:08,619
You shouldn't insult people
that are bigger than you.

462
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,824
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

463
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,601
No one gets to insult anyone.

464
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:15,280
No good's ever come of those questions.

465
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,202
No good's ever come?

466
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,644
You've asked questions before?

467
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,964
How can someone so small be
such a huge pain in my ass?

468
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,799
Were you asked questions?

469
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:30,331
The Hand of the King.
The Hands of the King.

470
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:33,897
Lord Arryn came first,
a few weeks before he died.

471
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,759
And then Lord Stark came,

472
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:38,137
a few weeks before he died.

473
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,799
Lord Stark.

474
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:44,111
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

475
00:31:45,544 --> 00:31:47,827
You'll probably be dead soon.

476
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,071
What did they ask about?

477
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:52,903
- My mom.
- Who's your mom?

478
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:54,593
Just my mom.

479
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,973
Worked in a tavern.
Died when I was little.

480
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,286
And who was your father?

481
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,314
He could be one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

482
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:03,519
What about you, anyway?

483
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,075
I thought they were after you?

484
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,244
Why?

485
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:11,924
Did you kill someone?
Or is it just because you're a girl?

486
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:14,633
- I'm not a girl!
- Yes you are.

487
00:32:14,814 --> 00:32:16,483
You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?

488
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:19,429
Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls.
Everyone knows that.

489
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,909
- That's true. You're still a girl.
- I am not!

490
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,570
Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.

491
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:27,201
I don't need to take a piss.

492
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,985
I'm in hot pike, aren't I now?

493
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:37,397
No one can know.

494
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:38,958
They won't.

495
00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:40,733
Not from me.

496
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,699
My name's not Arry.

497
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:49,788
It's Arya. Of House Stark.

498
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:53,604
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

499
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:56,143
He was your father.

500
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:59,720
- The Hand. The traitor.
- He was never a traitor.

501
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:01,578
Joffrey is a liar.

502
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,714
- So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
- No.

503
00:33:05,057 --> 00:33:06,246
I mean yes.

504
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,019
My mother was a lady, and my sister.

505
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,767
You were a lord's daughter
and you lived in a castle.

506
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,448
Look, all that about cocks.
I should never have said that.

507
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:17,544
I've been pissing in front
of you and everything.

508
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,686
- I should be calling you milady.
- Do not call me milady.

509
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,500
As milady commands.

510
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:25,103
Well, that was unladylike.

511
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,274
What you carrying?

512
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,242
Pears and oranges.

513
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:00,236
Wine from the Arbor.

514
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:03,924
And the heir to Pyke
of the Iron Islands.

515
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:10,376
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

516
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:15,452
Me.

517
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,671
Don't like wine.

518
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,732
Woman's drink.

519
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,459
I need to get to Pyke.

520
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:37,008
I'll find you a horse.

521
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:49,874
I'm heading that way.

522
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:51,432
I can take you there.

523
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:53,689
I bet you can.

524
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,920
You been at sea long?

525
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,217
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

526
00:34:58,631 --> 00:34:59,773
None like you.

527
00:34:59,803 --> 00:35:01,238
You don't know what I'm like.

528
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:03,148
You don't know what you're like.

529
00:35:03,712 --> 00:35:06,169
You need someone to teach you.

530
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:08,639
Do you now who I am?

531
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:12,523
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry.

532
00:35:13,097 --> 00:35:14,791
Lord Greyjoy.

533
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:20,163
Have my things sent up to the castle.

534
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:40,377
You should give me the reins,
I'm a better rider than you.

535
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,589
I've been on horseback
for the last nine years.

536
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,166
Nine years. You still know
your way around a ship?

537
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:48,929
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

538
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,097
Don't you worry about my hands.

539
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,779
The sea's in my blood.

540
00:35:55,558 --> 00:35:58,591
You'll never be in the sea if I
don't watch where I'm going.

541
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,723
I have a proposal for my father.

542
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,520
One that will make him king again.

543
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,970
And me after him.

544
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,188
You may stay at the castle
tonight, if you're lucky.

545
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,194
Is that an offer from my future king?

546
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,023
An order. From your future king.

547
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,894
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

548
00:36:20,938 --> 00:36:23,743
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

549
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:38,684
Father.

550
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,979
Nine years, is it?

551
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:45,222
They took a frightened boy.

552
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:47,188
What have they given back?

553
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:50,273
A man.

554
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:53,661
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

555
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:58,007
Stark had you longer than I did.

556
00:36:58,657 --> 00:37:00,699
Lord Stark is gone.

557
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,975
And how do you feel about that?

558
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:10,475
What's done is done.

559
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:14,749
- I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
- Who gave you those clothes?

560
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,277
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

561
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,558
- If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
- It will.

562
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:27,750
That bauble around your neck.

563
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,974
Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold?

564
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:33,773
I asked a question.

565
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,525
Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made

566
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:41,693
or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

567
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,149
Iron or gold?

568
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,497
Gold.

569
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,084
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

570
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,541
My fears have come true.

571
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:06,595
- The Starks have made you theirs.
- My blood is salt and iron.

572
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:10,345
Yet, the Stark boy sends you
to me like a trained raven,

573
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,794
- clutching his message.
- The offer he makes, is one I proposed.

574
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,357
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

575
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:19,246
hunted with him, fought at his side,
he thinks of me as a brother.

576
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:23,987
No, not here, not in my hearing,
you will not name him brother.

577
00:38:24,022 --> 00:38:28,699
This son of the man who put your
true brothers to the sword.

578
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:31,485
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

579
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,308
I forget nothing.

580
00:38:33,455 --> 00:38:35,281
I remember my brothers.

581
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,523
And I remember when
my father was a king.

582
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,146
I see.

583
00:38:57,623 --> 00:39:00,261
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

584
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:03,504
and he will make me King of
the Iron Islands once again.

585
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:06,474
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

586
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:10,141
I'm your son. Your only living heir.

587
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,864
Who else?

588
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,807
I told you to wait outside.

589
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,045
- How did you get past the guards?
- Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

590
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:24,618
My dear.

591
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:32,065
- Yara?
- So good to see you, brother.

592
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:36,759
This is a homecoming I'll
tell my grandchildren about.

593
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,061
- She can't lead an attack.
- And why not?

594
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:45,240
- You're a woman.
- You're the one in skirts.

595
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,336
This isn't Winterfell, boy.

596
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,999
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

597
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:52,281
after your new father killed him.

598
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,648
What's dead may never die.

599
00:39:56,678 --> 00:40:00,700
The only night she's spent off these
islands has been spent on the sea.

600
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:05,128
She's commanded men.
She's killed men.

601
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:07,309
She knows who she is.

602
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:12,710
No man gives me a crown.

603
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:15,453
I pay the iron price.

604
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:18,023
I will take my crown.

605
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,556
That is who I am.

606
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:24,129
That is who we have always been.

607
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,949
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

608
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:32,997
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

609
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:44,457
You'll have your gold when we take
the treasury at King's Landing.

610
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:48,466
All these kings fighting for the throne
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

611
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,738
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

612
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:54,331
Because you're a smart gambler.

613
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:57,253
Stannis has proved himself in war.
Twice.

614
00:40:57,502 --> 00:41:00,862
His baby brother has never
set foot on a battlefield.

615
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:04,431
- Neither has the false king, Joffrey.
- And yet, they both have larger armies.

616
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:06,653
Stannis has just begun the fight.

617
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,662
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

618
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:14,439
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.

619
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:15,916
Or more worthy of loyalty.

620
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:20,356
What is the world coming to when smugglers
must vouch for the honor of kings.

621
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:22,745
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

622
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:24,319
You think I'm insulted?

623
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:27,051
I am a pirate.
I'm an excellent pirate.

624
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,492
I don't sail for promises.

625
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:30,762
Of course you do.

626
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:33,903
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise.

627
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:35,238
A promise that somewhere on the seas,

628
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,771
somebody's got some gold and
you can take it from them.

629
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:40,695
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

630
00:41:41,177 --> 00:41:43,044
You're not the young man, Salladhor.

631
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:47,237
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

632
00:41:47,649 --> 00:41:49,213
Only the clever ones.

633
00:41:49,962 --> 00:41:51,664
You want to spend your last
few years on the sea,

634
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:55,227
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Midanese silk merchants,

635
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:57,279
then go.
They're out there waiting for you.

636
00:41:57,472 --> 00:41:58,851
That's easy.

637
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:01,713
What I'm offering you is hard.

638
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:07,143
Come with me and plunder the
greatest city in Westeros.

639
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,820
You'll be the richest man in Lysene.
And the most famous.

640
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:14,169
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

641
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:17,782
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.

642
00:42:17,812 --> 00:42:18,999
It is.

643
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:21,154
One thing, I want the queen.

644
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:23,989
- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.

645
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,773
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships,

646
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:29,198
and if we don't drown at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay,

647
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:32,437
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I will fuck her well.

648
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,272
This war isn't about you.

649
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,356
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

650
00:42:38,386 --> 00:42:41,060
I'm not going to rape her,
I'm going to fuck her.

651
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:45,238
- As if she would just let you.
- You don't know how persuasive I am.

652
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:47,203
I never tried to fuck you.

653
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:52,222
Stannis is the rightful king.
And the Lord of Light.

654
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:54,942
- The one true god.
- I've been all over the world, my boy,

655
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,907
and everywhere I go, people
tell me about the true god.

656
00:42:57,937 --> 00:43:00,046
They all think they found the right one.

657
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:03,210
The one true god is what's
between a woman's legs,

658
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,958
and better yet a queen's legs.

659
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:09,760
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

660
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,085
He's young yet.

661
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:13,741
I promise you the gold.

662
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:17,242
I promise you the glory.
I cannot promise you the queen.

663
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:22,550
You believe your king can win?

664
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:24,246
He is the one true king.

665
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:26,643
You Westerosers are funny people.

666
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:29,527
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

667
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:33,918
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

668
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:36,715
You are the most honest smuggler I ever met.

669
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,207
Make me rich.

670
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,825
Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.

671
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:57,254
<i>When will the King have a sail?</i>

672
00:43:57,284 --> 00:43:59,365
As soon as his God wills it.

673
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,243
He's my God too, and yours...

674
00:44:01,735 --> 00:44:04,235
but you were too blind to see.

675
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:08,571
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh you and your mother.

676
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:10,005
It won't take long you already know the letters.

677
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,474
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

678
00:44:12,505 --> 00:44:15,754
I wish I had a God, truly!
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men

679
00:44:15,784 --> 00:44:19,651
pray to every God there is. Pray for wind,
pray for rain, pray for home,

680
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:22,310
- None of it works!
- But you always came home.

681
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,387
I wasn't praying, you know.

682
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:25,733
But I was.

683
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:32,084
Every night that you're at sea,
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

684
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,846
You want me to have a god, fine.

685
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,157
King Stannis is my god.

686
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:40,898
He raised me up and blessed me with his trust.

687
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,776
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

688
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,228
You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday.
You think your

689
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:48,727
fire god commanded all that?

690
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,251
It was Stannis.

691
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:51,789
Only Stannis.

692
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:55,349
Stannis is my king,
but he's only a man.

693
00:44:55,641 --> 00:44:57,392
Don't tell him that.

694
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:03,604
Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the
City Watch. You had no right to exile him.

695
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,505
I have every right.
I am the King's Hand.

696
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:08,058
You're serving as the King's
Hand until father gets here.

697
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:10,947
- I am Queen Regent.
- Listen to me, Queen Regent,

698
00:45:10,977 --> 00:45:13,227
you're losing the people.

699
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:15,962
- Do you hear me?
- The people?

700
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:17,795
You think I care?

701
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:22,170
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

702
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,444
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

703
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:30,322
And gold-plated foes
just gave them the rallying cry.

704
00:45:30,626 --> 00:45:32,646
The Queen slaughters babies.

705
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,975
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

706
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:51,485
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

707
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:54,007
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

708
00:45:56,626 --> 00:45:57,825
Did he tell you?

709
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,224
I imagine that would be even worse.

710
00:46:00,254 --> 00:46:02,304
He did what needed to be done.

711
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:05,539
You want to be the Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

712
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:08,430
This is what ruling is!
Lying on a bed of weeds,

713
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,451
ripping them out by the root one by one
before they strangle you in your sleep.

714
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,948
I'm no king, but I think there's
more to ruling that that.

715
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:16,871
I don't care what you think!

716
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:21,010
You've never taken it seriously.
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

717
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:26,584
It's all fallen on me.

718
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:35,046
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

719
00:46:39,752 --> 00:46:41,001
You're funny.

720
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:46,839
You've always been funny.

721
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,509
But none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

722
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:54,246
You remember...

723
00:46:55,986 --> 00:47:01,234
Back when you ripped my mother open on
your way out of her and she bled to death.

724
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:03,563
She was my mother too.

725
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:06,283
Now they're gone,

726
00:47:08,257 --> 00:47:09,757
for the sake of you.

727
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:15,283
There's no bigger joke
in the world than that.

728
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,223
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

729
00:47:40,946 --> 00:47:42,896
How did it fare with your pirate?

730
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:48,287
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.
30 ships, his men know how to fight.

731
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,428
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

732
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:56,808
- Does seem the wiser choice.
- It won't be a choice this time.

733
00:47:57,347 --> 00:47:58,596
Do you trust him?

734
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:02,736
Salladhor Saan is an old friend,
I've known him 30 years.

735
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:04,767
I've never trusted him.

736
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:08,695
Now once he gets the smell
of gold, he never stops.

737
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:12,287
Well if he does his job, he'll have his share.

738
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,720
Leave us.

739
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,718
At once, Your Grace.

740
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:35,512
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

741
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,876
Come.

742
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:50,665
What did you say to him?

743
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:54,545
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

744
00:48:54,827 --> 00:48:56,877
- Why?
- Because it is true.

745
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:00,609
You're troubled my king.

746
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:02,167
Yeah.

747
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:05,434
These armies are but toys
for the Lord of Light.

748
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:07,962
Tell your lord to burn them then.

749
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:12,307
I tell him nothing!
I pray for his commands and I obey.

750
00:49:14,729 --> 00:49:18,229
My little brother has a hundred
thousand men according to the scouts.

751
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,438
Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

752
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:22,917
You must have faith.

753
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:24,754
Faith?

754
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,916
In a real war, the side with the greater
number wins nine times out of ten.

755
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,299
Then we must be the ten.

756
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:35,927
I cannot defeat my brother in the field,

757
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:41,336
and I can't take King's Landing
without the men he stole.

758
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:45,319
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.

759
00:49:47,664 --> 00:49:50,853
At first, you must give
yourself to the Lord of Light.

760
00:49:50,883 --> 00:49:53,528
I've said the words, damn you.

761
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,887
I burnt the idols.

762
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,193
You must give all of yourself.

763
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:12,794
I have a wife.

764
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,401
I took a vow.

765
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,601
She's sick.

766
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Weak.

767
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:25,323
Shut away in the tower.

768
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:28,265
She disgusts you.

769
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:33,915
And she's giving you nothing.

770
00:50:35,186 --> 00:50:36,486
No sons.

771
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:38,814
Only stillborns.

772
00:50:39,978 --> 00:50:41,123
Only death.

773
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:49,107
I will give you...

774
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:52,074
A son, my King.

775
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,848
A son?

776
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:39,606
