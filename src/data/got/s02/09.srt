1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,507
The substance burns so hot, it melts wood,
stone, even steel.

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:08,086
And, of course, flesh.

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:10,282
If I could tell you how many crazy old men

4
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:13,555
I've seen making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

5
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,864
Our order does not deal in pig shit.

6
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:17,615
King Stannis is my God.

7
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,869
He raised me up and gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

8
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,464
And you think a Fire God commanded all that?

9
00:00:23,494 --> 00:00:26,602
- It was Stannis.
- Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

10
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:28,219
Don't tell him that.

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,242
Does it give you joy to scare people?

12
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:32,569
No, it gives me joy to kill people.

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,775
Killing's the sweetest thing there is.

14
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,677
You shipped off my only daughter

15
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:39,889
and now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

16
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,411
He needs to be out there.

17
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,671
The men will fight more fiercely seeing
their king fighting beside them

18
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,018
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

19
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:50,726
Stannis two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

20
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:54,384
Scouts assure us Robb Stark won't risk
marching on Casterly Rock

21
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:56,032
until he's at full force.

22
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:57,913
He'll risk anything at any time.

23
00:00:57,943 --> 00:00:59,623
We'll ride at nightfall.

24
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:02,974
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

25
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,655
My dear nephew, you do understand Stannis
Baratheon sails this way?

26
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:10,592
They say Stannis never smiles.
I'll give him a red smile.

27
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:14,168
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's Landing in a day.

28
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:15,548
Will it hold?

29
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,474
Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

30
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:20,403
Stannis knows King's Landing.

31
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,733
He knows where the walls are strongest

32
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,362
and he knows which gates are weakest.

33
00:01:25,392 --> 00:01:28,115
Mud gate. That's where he'll land.

34
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:32,579
And if Stannis does attack
the mud gate, what do we have?

<i>That's it.</i>

40
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:51,515
<i>Come on</i>

41
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,316
The tide's against us.

42
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,755
Aye, but we have the wind.
She'll blow us straight to the gate.

43
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:10,384
You're coming home.

44
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:13,514
King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.

45
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:19,387
I spent most of my life
dodging the Royal Fleet.

46
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,007
And now I'm sailing right at them.

47
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:25,137
This is the Royal Fleet.

48
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,328
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

49
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:30,365
Of course there are several
Royal Fleets at the moment.

50
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:35,524
Not after tonight. When the sun rises,
Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne

51
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:37,069
and you will be his Hand.

52
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,296
- Gods be good.
- God.

53
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,267
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

54
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,645
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,180
The people of King's Landing did not choose
the false King Joffrey Baratheon.

56
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,210
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

57
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,338
Well, first we have to put it there.

58
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,648
Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one.

59
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:58,087
Our army outnumber theirs five to one.

60
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,433
Those walls have never been breached.

61
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:04,856
And the men guarding the walls,
when they see you, they don't see a liberator.

62
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:08,793
They see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

63
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,029
I have faith in the Lord of Light.

64
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,281
I have faith in our cause.

65
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:16,922
And I have faith in my captain.

66
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:53,076
Are you afraid, my lion?

67
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,440
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

68
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,987
Of course I'm afraid.

69
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:11,506
I won't let them hurt you.

70
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:17,047
I'm a Lannister.

71
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:20,185
I don't have a choice in all this.

72
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,367
But it's not your war.

73
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,654
It is now.

74
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:35,933
You...

75
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,494
can't fuck your way out of everything.

76
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,023
I have so far.

77
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,681
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

78
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,786
That I should make love to you like it was your
last day on this earth.

79
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,515
As you know, Your Grace,

80
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:11,201
it is not only the sworn duty of a Maester

81
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,619
to carry out the wishes of the house he serves,

82
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,311
but also to offer guidance

83
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:20,657
and counsel in times of war.

84
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:23,281
Your words are always wise and measured.

85
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,239
- If you could...
- If anything,

86
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:29,792
a Maester's duties become more urgent

87
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:33,166
in times of war and turmoil.

88
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:37,455
I remember back in the days of king...

89
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:39,482
You brought me something?

90
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:41,589
Yes.

91
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:47,104
Essence of Nightshade

92
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,207
is as dangerous as it is efficacious.

93
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,848
A single drop in a cup of wine

94
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:58,742
suffices to soothe ragged nerves.

95
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,359
Three drops will bring on a deep
and dreamless sleep.

96
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:06,518
10 drops, however...

97
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,253
I know what 10 drops will bring.

98
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:09,483
Your Grace,

99
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,183
- if I may ask...
- You may not.

100
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,872
You must have a lot of work to do.

101
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:20,272
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

102
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:22,375
Yes.

103
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,192
A siege is very...

104
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:27,418
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

105
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,306

115
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,231
Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

116
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,852
Drunk Lannisters.

117
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:15,437
- You've got a pretty voice.
- Thank you very much.

118
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,548
And I like your nose.

119
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,305
How many times you break it?

120
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,234
Well, now let's see.

121
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,931
First time I was five.

122
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,320
Me mom smacked me with an iron poker.

123
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,589
Oh, it wasn't me she was aiming at.

124
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:35,215
She was trying for me little brother.

125
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,702
Now he was a real pest.

126
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:38,191
Second time...

127
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,386
I was nine.

128
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:43,372
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.

129
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:45,183
They won.

130
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,014
Third time...

131
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:57,963
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

132
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:03,107
Poor nose.

133
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,566
Don't feel sorry for him.

134
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:10,049
He'll be halfway up your ass
before the night's through.

135
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,625
<i>It's the last one...</i>

136
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:21,547
Welcome, friends.

137
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,387
This round's on me.

138
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:39,028
I don't think he likes me.

139
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,449
You think you're a hard man?

140
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,375
I know it.

141
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:03,823
It's warm in here.

142
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,650
We've got beautiful women

143
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,155
and good brown ale.

144
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:10,697
Plenty for everyone.

145
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,946
And all you want

146
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:15,787
is to put one of us in the cold ground

147
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:18,395
with no women to keep us company.

148
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,427
Oh, there's women in the ground.

149
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,917
I put some there myself.

150
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:25,450
So have you.

151
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,358
You like fucking and drinking

152
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:30,750
and singing.

153
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:34,850
But killing...

154
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,703
killing's the thing you love.

155
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:40,917
You're just like me.

156
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:46,068
Only smaller.

157
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,137
And quicker.

158
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,184
Eh?

159
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,999
Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you.

160
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
<i>Aye.</i>

161
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:09,714
I expect he will someday.

162
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,963
<i>Here we are.</i>

163
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:31,094
One more drink before the war?

164
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,304
Shall we?

165
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,898
I've always hated the bells.

166
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,047
They ring for horror...

167
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,653
a dead king, a city under siege.

168
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:52,805
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

169
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,945
Podrick, is that it?

170
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:58,179
"Is that it?"

171
00:13:58,209 --> 00:13:59,449
Nice touch.

172
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,997
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

173
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:05,469
I'm not entirely sure
what you're suggesting.

174
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:09,652
I'm entirely sure you're entirely
sure what I'm suggesting.

175
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,151
Do you trust him?

176
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:17,046
Oddly enough, I do.

177
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,491
Good.

178
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:27,514
The map you asked for.

179
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:34,083
There must be 20 miles
of tunnels beneath the city.

180
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:35,768
Closer to 50.

181
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:39,517
The Targaryens built this
city to withstand a siege

182
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,286
and to provide escape if necessary.

183
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,785
I'm not escaping.

184
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,169
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship.

185
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,170
And if the ship goes down, I go with her.

186
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,897
That is good to hear.

187
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:55,384
Though I'm sure many captains say the same
while their ship is afloat.

188
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,942
You look well suited for battle, My Lord.

189
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:00,254
Well, I'm not.

190
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,962
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.

191
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,598
My little birds tell me
that Stannis Baratheon

192
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,105
has taken up with a
Red Priestess from Asshai.

193
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,135
What of it?

194
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:16,003
You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord?

195
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:20,168
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting...
what do you think?

196
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:23,002
I think you believe in what you see

197
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:27,044
and in what those you trust have seen.

198
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,869
You probably don't entirely trust me.

199
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,060
Mm, don't take it personally.

200
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,457
I don't entirely trust myself.

201
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:37,699
And yet I have seen things

202
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:39,749
and heard things...

203
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:44,750
things you have not,
things I wish I had not.

204
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:50,650
I don't believe I've ever told you
how I was cut.

205
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:54,706
No, I don't believe you have.

206
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,003
One day I will.

207
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,560
The dark arts have provided
Lord Stannis with his armies

208
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,938
and paved his path to our door.

209
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:11,289
For a man in service to such
powers to sit on the Iron Throne,

210
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:13,771
I can think of nothing worse.

211
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:16,229
And tonight,

212
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,821
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

213
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,120
They're welcoming the new king.

214
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,841
I've never known bells to mean surrender.

215
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,240
They want to play music with us?
Let's play. Drums.

216
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,483
Drums!

217
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:26,486
- Remember, wait till the shit...
- The ships are in the bay.

218
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:29,790
- They must be far enough in so they won't be...
- I know what "in" means.

219
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,595
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

220
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,587
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

221
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,509
I saw you kill a man with a shield.

222
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,474
You'll be unstoppable with an axe.

223
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,767
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

224
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,712
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

225
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:49,046
Just because I pay you for your services
doesn't diminish our friendship.

226
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:50,533
Enhances it, really.

227
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:53,187
Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword.

228
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:55,891
Been spending time with fancy folks.

229
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:10,328
Lady Sansa and, uh, Sheila.

230
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:12,999
Shae.
Shae, yes.

231
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:17,372
Surely my sister has asked you to join
the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

232
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:21,841
She has, My Lord,
but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

233
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,335
- Sansa.
- He's been a great romantic, my nephew.

234
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,153
Sansa, come here.

235
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:32,499
I will pray for your safe return, My Lord.

236
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:36,108
- Will you?
- Just as I pray for the King's.

237
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,920
- Stay safe, My Lady.
- And you, my lion.

238
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:51,486
Your king rides forth to battle.

239
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:55,064
You should see him off with a kiss.

240
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:57,068
My new blade.

241
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,456
Hearteater I've named it.

242
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,938
Kiss it.

243
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,677
You'll kiss it again when I return

244
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,562
and taste my Uncle's blood.

245
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:18,336
Will you slay him yourself?

246
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:21,971
If Stannis is fool enough
to come near me.

247
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:25,702
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the Vanguard?

248
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:30,102
A king doesn't discuss
battle plans with stupid girls.

249
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,152
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You're right, I'm stupid.

250
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,378
Of course you'll be in the Vanguard.

251
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,881
They say my brother Robb always goes
where the fighting is thickest.

252
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,846
And he is only a pretender.

253
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,317
Your brother's turn will come.

254
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:47,542
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

255
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:01,643
Some of those boys will never come back.

256
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,555
Joffrey will.

257
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:06,176
The worst ones always live.

258
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:08,913
Come, My Lady.

259
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:59,276
- Where's our fleet?
- On the way.

260
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,961
Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

261
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:07,393
Hound, tell the Hand that his
King has asked him a question.

262
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:09,535
The King has asked you a question.

263
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,711
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king
that the Hand is extremely busy.

264
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,798
The Hand of the King would like me to tell
you to tell the King...

265
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:20,074
If I tell the Hound to cut you in half,
he'll do it without a second thought.

266
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,972
That would make me the Quarterman.

267
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:25,011
It just doesn't have the same ring to it.

268
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:28,041
Cut me in half and I won't
be able to give the signal.

269
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:29,462
No signal, no plan.

270
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:33,320
No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city,
takes the Iron Throne,

271
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:36,797
puts your pinched
little head atop a gate somewhere.

272
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:38,592
It might be quite amusing,

273
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:40,927
except that my head would be up there, too.

274
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:42,681
I've never much liked my head,

275
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:45,429
but I don't want to see it
removed just yet.

276
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,096
Where are their ships?

277
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:52,835
It is wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

278
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:55,948
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

279
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:57,606
There are no surprises here.

280
00:21:57,636 --> 00:21:59,894
If it's true there is dissension
in their ranks,

281
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:02,258
maybe their sailors have mutinied.

282
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,319
Maybe.

283
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:21,637
I don't know why she wants me here.

284
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:24,713
She's always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.

285
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:28,680
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

286
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,474
I doubt it.

287
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,727
Maybe she's jealous of you.

288
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:35,933
Why would she be jealous?

289
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,218
Sansa.

290
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,923
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

291
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,743
You look pale, child.

292
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,927
Is your red flower still blooming?

293
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,159
Yes.

294
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:53,447
Fitting, isn't it?

295
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:57,702
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

296
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,784
Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

297
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:02,244
- I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.
- So?

298
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,438
I didn't offer you water.

299
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,997
What's he doing here?

300
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,295
Ser Ilyn?

301
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:14,889
He's here to defend us.

302
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:19,300
When the axes smash down those doors,
you may be glad to have him.

303
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,278
But we have guards to defend us.

304
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:22,830
Guards we have paid.

305
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:27,602
Should the city fall, they'll be the
first ones out of the doors.

306
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,791
The lads caught a groom and
two maids trying to sneak away

307
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:35,278
with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

308
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,838
The battle's first traitors.

309
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,513
Have Ser Ilyn see to them.

310
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:44,122
Put their heads on spikes outside
the stables as a warning.

311
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:49,291
The only way to keep the small folk loyal
is to make certain they fear you

312
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:52,407
more than they do the enemy.
Remember that...

313
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,710
if you ever hope to become a queen.

314
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:59,193
You said he was here to protect us.

315
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,404
He is.

316
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,724
Traitors are a danger to us all.

317
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,050
More wine.

318
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,792
There they are.

319
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,951
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers,

320
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,849
to your marks!

321
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:34,980
<i>Archers!</i>

322
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,543
Nock your arrows!

323
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,677
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

324
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:48,242
- Hold fast.
<i>- Hold fast!</i>

325
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,787
What are you doing?
We need to attack them.

326
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:54,335
- Hold fast.
<i>- Boulders ready!</i>

327
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:56,870
<i>Hold fast!</i>

328
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,238
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

329
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:04,849
Where are the rest of them?!

330
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,224
There's only one ship.

331
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:16,631
Archers, stand to!

332
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,271
Man the below!

333
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,710
- Nock!
<i>- Nock and set!</i>

334
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:22,834
Draw!

335
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,453
Hold.

336
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,156
<i>Hold!</i>

337
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,543
There's no one on board.

338
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:50,722
<i>More rocks coming up!</i>

339
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,259
<i>Hold.</i>

340
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:16,707
Wildfire.

341
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,714
Steer clear! Steer clear!

342
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,508
Matthos! Get down!

343
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,827
- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace...

344
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:25,880
- The dwarf has played his little trick.
- The wildfire...

345
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,760
He can only play it once.

346
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,175
We're too far from the gates.

347
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,697
The fire, their archers...

348
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:34,553
hundreds will die.

349
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,064
Thousands.

350
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:53,685
Come with me and take this city!

351
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:14,275
Sansa, come here, little dove.

352
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,520
My queen.

353
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,598
What are you doing?

354
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:25,226
Praying.

355
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:27,650
You're perfect, aren't you?

356
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:29,166
Praying.

357
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,951
What are you praying for?

358
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:35,016
For the Gods to have mercy on us all.

359
00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:37,663
On all of us?

360
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,119
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

361
00:29:40,816 --> 00:29:42,447
Of course, Your Grace.

362
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:43,834
Even Joffrey?

363
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:49,254
- Joffrey is my...
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

364
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:52,406
Praying to the Gods
to have mercy on us all.

365
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:56,231
The Gods have no mercy.
That's why they're Gods.

366
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:59,961
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

367
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,725
My mother just died, you see.

368
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:05,259
I didn't really understand
the concept of death,

369
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:06,988
the finality of it.

370
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:10,382
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,

371
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:12,764
the Gods would return
my mother to me.

372
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,203
I was four.

373
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:16,318
Your father doesn't believe in the Gods?

374
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:19,787
He believes in them, he just
doesn't like them very much.

375
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:23,518
One for her.

376
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:28,779
Here.

377
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:32,243
Sit.

378
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:33,876
Drink.

379
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,608
Not like that. Drink, girl.

380
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:45,094
I should have been born a man.

381
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,153
I'd rather face 1,000 swords

382
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:50,857
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

383
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,752
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

384
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,855
It was expected of me,

385
00:30:56,885 --> 00:31:00,907
as it will be of you if you ever
become Joffrey's queen.

386
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:04,734
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

387
00:31:04,764 --> 00:31:07,867
these hens will return to their cocks

388
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:11,864
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

389
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:13,931
lifted their spirits.

390
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,157
And if the city should fall?

391
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,873
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

392
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,955
The Red Keep should hold for a time,

393
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:27,572
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

394
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,270
If it were anyone else outside those gates,
I might have hoped for a private audience.

395
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,061
But this is Stannis Baratheon.

396
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,546
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

397
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,131
Have I shocked you, little dove?

398
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:47,795
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

399
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:53,204
The best one's between your legs.
Learn how to use it.

400
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:55,048
Drink.

401
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,085
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

402
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:05,550
No, you wouldn't, would you?

403
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,688
If the city falls, these fine women

404
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,850
should be in for a bit of a rape.

405
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,917
Half of them will have bastards
in their bellies come the morning.

406
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,384
You'll be glad of your red flower then.

407
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:27,010
When a man's blood is up,
anything with tits looks good.

408
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,828
A precious thing like you
will look very, very good.

409
00:32:32,837 --> 00:32:37,113
A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.

410
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,115
<i>More pressure!</i>

411
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,132
<i>- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!</i>

412
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:58,408
<i>Pull! Pull!</i>

413
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:00,345
<i>That's it!</i>

414
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,617
<i>Steady!</i>

415
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,151
He's a serious man... Stannis Baratheon.

416
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,317
They're coming. They're coming ashore.

417
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:11,057
Rain fire on them.

418
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:12,422
Archers!

419
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:13,605
There are too many.

420
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:16,563
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

421
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:19,133
that manages to touch solid ground.

422
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:21,862
Pod,

423
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:23,992
run to the King's gate.

424
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:26,310
Bring any men guarding it here now.

425
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,449
Yes, My Lord.

426
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:31,360
Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.

427
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:32,837
You, too.

428
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,536
Any of these flaming fucking
arrows come near me,

429
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:40,362
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

430
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,095
<i>Pull, pull! Go!</i>

431
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:48,435
Nock!

432
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,449
<i>Draw!</i>

433
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,773
<i>- Draw!
- Draw!</i>

434
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:08,103
<i>Kill the Lannisters!</i>

435
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:09,303
Loose!

436
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:10,837
<i>Loose!</i>

437
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:15,711
<i>Form the line!</i>

438
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:19,954
<i>Stannis!</i>

439
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,472
- Draw!
<i>- Draw!</i>

440
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:23,505
- Loose!
- Loose!

441
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:49,722
<i>They cannot breach the wall!</i>

442
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:11,453
To the mud gate, go now!

443
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:13,600
First and second squads, to the gate!

444
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:14,929
To the mud gate!

445
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,999
Any man dies with a clean sword,

446
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:19,095
I'll rape his fucking corpse.

447
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:56,453
When we were young, Jaime and I,

448
00:35:56,483 --> 00:36:00,201
we looked so much alike.
Even our father couldn't tell us apart.

449
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:04,853
I could never understand why
they treated us differently.

450
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:08,790
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

451
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:13,623
and I was taught to smile
and sing and please.

452
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:16,118
He was heir to Casterly Rock

453
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:19,327
and I was sold to some
stranger like a horse

454
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,676
to be ridden whenever he desired.

455
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:23,337
You were Robert's queen.

456
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:26,373
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

457
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,889
I don't think I know this one.

458
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:39,014
Pretty.

459
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:48,191
That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

460
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:51,287
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

461
00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:53,377
Straighten your back and bend.

462
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,878
Better. You learn fast.

463
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:02,108
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

464
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:06,078
A few weeks, Your Grace.

465
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:11,494
When did you leave Lorath?

466
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,798
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

467
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:20,165
But she was a nobleman's daughter.

468
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:21,795
You're not.

469
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:28,533
When did you come to Westeros?

470
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:30,367
10 years ago, Your Grace.

471
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:35,743
From Lorathi commoner to the
Red Keep in 10 years,

472
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:38,573
all without learning how to curtsy.

473
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:42,057
I imagine that's a very interesting story.

474
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:44,457
What's your name?

475
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,195
Shae, Your Grace.

476
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,010
Tell us a story, Shae.

477
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,868
When I was 13, I...

478
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,793
Your Grace!

479
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:02,232
What news?

480
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,302
The Imp has set the river afire.

481
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:07,989
Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.

482
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,519
Stannis's fleet destroyed, but...

483
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:13,355
But... but...

484
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,988
his troops have landed
outside the city walls.

485
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,412
Where is Joffrey?

486
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,529
On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

487
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,171
Bring him back inside at once.

488
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,951
- But, Your Grace...
- What?

489
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:29,221
The King's presence is good for morale.

490
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,951
Bring him back to his chambers now.

491
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,791
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

492
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:36,340
Do you want him to be mocked as
a coward for the rest of his life?

493
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,520
- No, but I...
- Now!

494
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,923
When I told you about
Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.

495
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:50,925
Do you want to hear the truth?

496
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,605
You want to know why he's really here?

497
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,321
He's here for us.

498
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,692
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

499
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:02,517
but he will not take us alive.

500
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:38,431
<i>Ah! Help me!</i>

501
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:58,949
<i>We'd better run!</i>

502
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
<i>Fall back!</i>

503
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,569
Get the ladders up!

504
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:46,098
Faster, you bastards! Faster!

505
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:48,448
Come on, kill the scum!

506
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,430
Someone bring me a drink.

507
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,852
Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

508
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:14,380
Can I get you some iced milk

509
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,073
and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

510
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:18,903
Eat shit, dwarf.

511
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:21,002
You're on the wrong side of the wall.

512
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:23,234
I lost half my men.

513
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,231
The Blackwater's on fire.

514
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,769
Dog, I command you to go
back out there and fight.

515
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:35,891
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

516
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:38,771
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city...

517
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,362
your king's city.

518
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:44,321
Fuck the Kingsguard.

519
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,025
Fuck the city.

520
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,930
Fuck the King.

521
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,570
<i>- Loose!
- Put your backs into it!</i>

522
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,527
All right, get up!

523
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,330
Loose!

524
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:19,966
<i>- Clear!
- Forward!</i>

525
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,490
Loose!

526
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,787
<i>Forward ladders!

527
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:53,192
<i>They're coming up the wall!</i>

528
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,190
<i>Archers on the north wall!</i>

529
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
Your Grace,

530
00:43:02,202 --> 00:43:05,652
the queen has sent me to bring
you back to the Red Keep.

531
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,522
If you won't defend your
own city, why should they?

532
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:13,052
- What would you have me do?
- Lead.

533
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:17,280
Get down there and lead your people
against the invaders who want to kill them.

534
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,291
What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?

535
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:22,371
She did not say, Your Grace.

536
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:25,481
<i>All men to the battlements!</i>

537
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,330
Ser Boros, Ser Mandon,

538
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,228
stay with my Uncle and represent the king
on the field of battle.

539
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,765
<i>Archers, hold your line
or I'll kill you myself.</i>

540
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,944
<i>Stand fast!</i>

541
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:53,227
No!

542
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,611
<i>Get up, you fool.</i>

543
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,340
<i>We need more arrows!</i>

544
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:04,231
<i>Where is the king?</i>

545
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:07,978
<i>- Why isn't he with us?
- Who are we fighting for?</i>

546
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:11,078
<i>Who leads us?</i>

547
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,680
I'll lead the attack.

548
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,170
I'll lead the attack!

549
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:18,741
<i>- Yes?
- What are you talking about?</i>

550
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:20,601
Pod, my helmet.

551
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,852
Ser Mandon, you will bear the King's banner.

552
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:26,482
Men, form up.

553
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,218
Men...

554
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,420
men!

555
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:35,426
- Come on.
- They say I'm half a man.

556
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:38,321
But what does that make the lot of you?

557
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,341
The only way out is through the gates.

558
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:42,862
And they're at the gates.

559
00:44:42,892 --> 00:44:46,090
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

560
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:50,262
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their asses.

561
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
<i>Heave!</i>

562
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,550
<i>Heave!</i>

563
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:57,360
Don't fight for your king

564
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,590
and don't fight for his kingdoms.

565
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:03,691
Don't fight for honor.
Don't fight for glory.

566
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:06,411
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

567
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:08,892
This is your city Stannis means to sack.

568
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:12,201
That's your gate he's ramming.
If he gets in,

569
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:14,931
it will be your houses he burns,

570
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,543
your gold he steals,

571
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:20,373
your women he will rape.

572
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,210
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

573
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
<i>Heave!</i>

574
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,268
Those are brave me knocking at our door.

575
00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:34,095
Let's go kill them.

576
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,574
The battle is lost, Your Grace.

577
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:02,077
Stannis's troops are at the gates.

578
00:46:02,186 --> 00:46:04,831
When the Gold Cloaks
saw the king leaving,

579
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,805
they lost all heart.

580
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,402
Where is my son?

581
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,911
I want to escort him back to the battle.

582
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:13,590
Why do I care what you want?

583
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,520
- Bring me...
- Now listen to me... ah!

584
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:23,930
Don't be afraid.

585
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,809
The queen has raised the drawbridge.
This is the safest place we can be.

586
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,820
Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

587
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,198
His knights have rallied behind him.
They will save the city.

588
00:46:35,141 --> 00:46:37,093
Shall we sing a hymn?

589
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,205
<i>♪ Gentle mother ♪
♪ font of mercy ♪</i>

590
00:46:42,373 --> 00:46:46,620
<i>♪ save our sons from war, we pray ♪</i>

591
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:49,729
- ♪ gentle... ♪
- You must go.

592
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,365
Run to your chamber and bar your door.

593
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:54,448
Stannis won't hurt you.

594
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,178
This one will.

595
00:46:58,376 --> 00:46:59,510
Come with me.

596
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,483
I need to say goodbye to someone.

597
00:47:01,513 --> 00:47:03,687
The queen said they'd rape everyone.

598
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,467
No one is raping me.

599
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:09,247
Go. Run.

600
00:47:10,826 --> 00:47:15,930
<i>♪ save our sons from war, we pray. ♪</i>

601
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:51,426
The lady is starting to panic.

602
00:47:52,058 --> 00:47:53,358
What are you doing here?

603
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:55,099
Not here for long.

604
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:58,082
- I'm going.
- Where?

605
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,635
Someplace that isn't burning.

606
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:05,365
North, might be.

607
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,841
Could be.

608
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:08,899
What about the king?

609
00:48:10,771 --> 00:48:13,771
He can die just fine on his own.

610
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:21,317
I can take you with me.

611
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:24,489
Take you to Winterfell.

612
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:30,987
I'll keep you safe.

613
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,740
Do you want to go home?

614
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,700
I'll be safe here.

615
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:42,962
Stannis won't hurt me.

616
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:45,849
Look at me.

617
00:48:47,368 --> 00:48:49,068
Stannis is a killer.

618
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:52,129
The Lannisters are killers.

619
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,590
Your father was a killer.

620
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,549
Your brother is a killer.

621
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:01,608
Your sons will be killers someday.

622
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:05,601
The world is built by killers.

623
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:12,082
So you'd better get used
to looking at them.

624
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,359
You won't hurt me.

625
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,330
No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

626
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:52,710
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

627
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:00,877
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!

628
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:05,934
Attack!

629
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:22,134
Roll it over!

630
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:34,012
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

631
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:42,701
Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

632
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:46,177
Oh, fuck me.

633
00:51:40,355 --> 00:51:41,875
Be calm, my sweet.

634
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:43,705
They're still fighting.

635
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:47,852
No one's going to hurt you.

636
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,360
I'll tell you a story.

637
00:51:54,704 --> 00:51:57,853
You know the one about the
mother lion and her little cub?

638
00:51:57,883 --> 00:52:00,427
- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood.

639
00:52:00,546 --> 00:52:01,846
Yes, my love.

640
00:52:02,776 --> 00:52:04,165
In the Kingswood

641
00:52:04,195 --> 00:52:06,304
there lived a mother and her cub.

642
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:08,684
She loved him very much.

643
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:13,269
But there were other things
that lived in the woods. Evil things.

644
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:14,399
Like what?

645
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:18,814
Like stags.

646
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:21,154
Stags aren't evil.

647
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:22,734
They only eat grass.

648
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:24,647
And wolves.

649
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,270
My Lord.

650
00:52:26,596 --> 00:52:28,892
<i>He could hear them howling in the night.</i>

651
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:30,772
<i>The little cub was frightened.</i>

652
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,710
<i>His mother said,</i>

653
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,445
<i>"You are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid.</i>

654
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,826
For one day all the beasts
will bow to you.

655
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:53,356
You will be king.

656
00:52:55,603 --> 00:52:59,190
All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.

657
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,199
The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

658
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,856
all the birds in the sky
and the beasts in the sea...

659
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:13,072
they will all come to you, little lion...

660
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,907
to rest a crown upon your head."

661
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:23,132
And the cub said,

662
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:26,561
"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

663
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:29,382
"Yes," said his mother.

664
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:33,500
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

665
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,410
I will keep you safe,

666
00:53:54,844 --> 00:53:55,894
my love.

667
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,017
I promise you.

668
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:08,346
<i>Back to the boats!</i>

669
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:12,204
Stand and fight!

670
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:16,314
<i>Stand and fight, damn you!</i>

671
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:18,521
No!

672
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:23,038
Father.

673
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,085
The battle is over.

674
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:32,882
We have won.
