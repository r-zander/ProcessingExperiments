1
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:02,791
<i>Maester Luwin,</i>
<i>send a raven to Pyke</i>

2
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,847
informing my father
of my victory here.

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:06,896
And one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

4
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:10,366
Inform her that she's to
bring 500 men to Winterfell.

5
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:11,834
When do we sail
for King's Landing?

6
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:14,003
Soon as I've consolidated
my troops.

7
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,477
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

8
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:19,508
The fist of the First Men.
Thousands of years ago

9
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,909
the First Men stood here.

10
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:22,844
They came here to get
away from something.

11
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,289
And I don't think
it worked.

12
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,649
<i>Do you really think I'll let</i>
<i>you ship Myrcella off to Dorne?</i>

13
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,105
Dorne is the safest
place for her.

14
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:31,655
I want you to know what
it's like to love someone,

15
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,684
to truly love someone
before I take her from you.

16
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,928
You let a halfwit escape
with a cripple?

17
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,197
<i>And Rickon, too?</i>
<i>The little one?</i>

18
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,599
<i>Gone, along with</i>
<i>the wildling woman.</i>

19
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,134
Wait, I know that farm.

20
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,570
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

21
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,372
I've been treating
your wounded men.

22
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,440
<i>I've already run through the</i>
<i>supplies I brought with me.</i>

23
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:51,476
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender.

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,269
Come with me to the Crag. Let
the Maester show you his stores.

25
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:03,690
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

26
00:01:04,353 --> 00:01:05,775
<i>They want your head.</i>

27
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:08,266
Old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

28
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,919
You strangled his son
with your chains.

29
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:14,367
- He was in my way.
- You are a man without honor.

30
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:16,036
Brienne, your sword.

31
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:19,873
You have my dragons?

32
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,171
I will take you to
the House of the Undying

33
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,039
where I have put them.

34
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,749
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

35
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:30,819
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally

36
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,921
<i>and what would happen</i>
<i>if you did not.</i>

37
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,876
What have you done?

38
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,157
<i>If there are any among</i>
<i>you who still question</i>

39
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,965
whether your new lord
means what he says...

40
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:39,374
No!

45
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,948
<i>- Rider approaching!</i>
<i>- Open the gate!</i>

46
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,329
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

47
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:20,653
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

48
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,630
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

49
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,100
I took the great castle
of Winterfell with 20 men.

50
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,038
You're a great warrior.

51
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,667
I saw the bodies above your gates.

52
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,413
Which one gave you
the tougher fight,

53
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,580
the cripple or the six-year-old?

54
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,874
I treated the Stark
boys with honor

55
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:40,842
and they repaid me
with treachery.

56
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:43,919
You treated them with honor
by butchering them?

57
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,048
- Before I had to kill them, I treated them--
- you seized their home, as is your right.

58
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:50,920
- We're Ironborn; We take what we need.
- Exactly.

59
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,956
Then you made them prisoners in
their home and they ran away.

60
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,126
Is that treachery?

61
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,021
I'd call it bravery.

62
00:04:58,356 --> 00:04:59,753
They made me a promise--

63
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:01,854
Your little boy prisoners
made you a promise

64
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:04,313
and you got mad
when they broke it?

65
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:06,202
Are you the dumbest
cunt alive?

66
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,042
- Don't call me a--
- A cunt.

67
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,201
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

68
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,269
You know how valuable
those boys were?

69
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,412
If I hadn't killed them, the
Northerners would think me weak.

70
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:20,128
You are weak.
And you're stupid.

71
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm warning you.

72
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,449
Go on, then,

73
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,063
warn me.

74
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,194
You haven't brought
enough men.

75
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:34,629
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

76
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:37,401
You're not. I've come to bring
you home.

77
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:40,267
- Father wants a word.
- Is this a joke?

78
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:41,969
Winterfell is the heart
of the North.

79
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:45,906
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles
from the sea.

80
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,415
We're islanders,
baby brother.

81
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,109
<i>Had you forgotten that?</i>

82
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,845
<i>Our power comes</i>
<i>from our ships.</i>

83
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:53,947
<i>And now that you've</i>
<i>decorated your walls</i>

84
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,682
<i>with the bodies</i>
<i>of the Stark boys,</i>

85
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:59,401
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

86
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,328
When Robb Stark
finds out--

87
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,889
He won't find out.
We've killed all the ravens.

88
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,289
We have all the horses.

89
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,708
I've taken Winterfell.

90
00:06:09,925 --> 00:06:12,567
And I will keep Winterfell.

91
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,614
Leave us.

92
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,884
Theon, you're my blood.

93
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,198
We both loved our mother.

94
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:39,198
We both endured our father.

95
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:43,556
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.

96
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,798
I don't intend to die.

97
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,708
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

98
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:58,079
Bawling all the time,
never sleeping.

99
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,869
And one night you just
wouldn't shut up,

100
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,194
screaming like a dying pig.

101
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,168
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

102
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:12,352
I wanted to strangle you.

103
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:16,969
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

104
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:19,804
You smiled at me.

105
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:27,051
Don't die so far from the sea.

106
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:44,950
I've brought you
a present, Lord of Bones.

107
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:48,464
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.

108
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,666
Mance will want
to question this one.

109
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,487
<i>Knows all about where the crows</i>
<i>are and what they're planning.</i>

110
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:57,139
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

111
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:58,440
Gut him.

112
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,243
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

113
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:04,045
And now he wishes he did.
Gut him.

114
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:08,350
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

115
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,717
Mance will want him.

116
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,673
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

117
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,287
I don't know.

118
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,630
I think he'll want
to decide for himself.

119
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:31,053
He runs, I'll chop
his balls off.

120
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,526
He runs, I'll do it meself.

121
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,620
We're even now,
Jon Snow.

122
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,737
I couldn't do it.

123
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:01,057
I had the sword at her neck,
I just couldn't--

124
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,394
I know.

125
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,257
The others?

126
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,376
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

127
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,716
We found your tracks
fast enough.

128
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,982
But they found us
before we found you.

129
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,048
They died because of me.

130
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,755
See that it wasn't for nothing.

131
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,257
<i>All right, up, lad.

132
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,126
Come on,
on your feet, now.

133
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,499
Move it.

134
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,327
Is she beautiful?

135
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:34,377
I've never met her.

136
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,185
What's her name?

137
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,102
Frey, I suppose.

138
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,301
I don't know her first name.

139
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,135
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

140
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,889
And you're marrying
her for a bridge?

141
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:51,432
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

142
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,733
It was before
they killed my father.

143
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:58,361
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

144
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:01,263
but only if I crossed
that bridge.

145
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,337
When I speak to people
from the North,

146
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:07,808
they all loved your father.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,343
He was the best man
I ever met.

148
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,279
I know children always think
that about their fathers, but he truly--

149
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:18,751
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

150
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:23,656
He once told me that being
a Lord is like being a father,

151
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:26,025
except you have
thousands of children

152
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:28,234
and you worry about
all of them.

153
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,330
The farmers plowing
the fields are yours to protect.

154
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,667
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

155
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,546
The soldiers
you order into battle.

156
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,674
He told me he woke
with fear in the morning

157
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,976
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

158
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,781
I didn't believe him.

159
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:49,837
I asked him,

160
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,740
"how can a man be brave
if he's afraid?"

161
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,823
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

162
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:03,095
I wish I could have
met him.

163
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:05,497
He would have
liked you.

164
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:10,508
Most Lords worry more
about their gold and their glory

165
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:12,304
than the charwomen
scrubbing their floors.

166
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:14,529
He didn't care much
about gold or glory.

167
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:16,039
And you?

168
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:20,025
You think I'm fighting this war so
they'll sing songs about me?

169
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,614
I want to go home.

170
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,316
I want the men
following me to go home.

171
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:26,884
Then why don't you?

172
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,282
Because we'll never be safe until
the Lannisters are defeated.

173
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:32,789
And because I believe
in justice.

174
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,969
Chopping off
Joffrey's head, you mean.

175
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:37,016
That would be a start.

176
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,297
Your Grace, Milady.

177
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:51,609
The Kingslayer,
he escaped in the night.

178
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,398
How?

179
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:56,579
How?!

180
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,189
Tell me this isn't true.

181
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:08,839
Why?

182
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,900
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.

183
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,791
- Robb--
- No!

184
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:16,730
You knew I would
not allow it

185
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,582
and you did it anyway.

186
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:22,923
Bran and Rickon
are captives in Winterfell.

187
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,813
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

188
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,769
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

189
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,786
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

190
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:36,890
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

191
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:38,942
You commit treason

192
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:41,668
<i>because your children</i>
<i>are prisoners?</i>

193
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,257
<i>I would carve out</i>
<i>my heart</i>

194
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,943
and offer it to the father
if he would let my sons

195
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:50,331
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

196
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,923
I grieve for
your sons, My Lord.

197
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,728
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

198
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:57,611
And you stole it from me.

199
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:02,468
Killing Jaime Lannister would not
buy life for your children,

200
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:06,698
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

201
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:10,715
Jaime Lannister has played
you for a fool.

202
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:12,925
You've weakened
our position.

203
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,621
You've brought discord
into our camp.

204
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,500
And you did it all
behind my back.

205
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,540
Make sure she's guarded
day and night.

206
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,472
Robb.

207
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,590
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

208
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,916
40, Your Grace.

209
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:31,040
Send another 40
with our fastest horses.

210
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,134
Robb.

211
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,580
Damn.

212
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:57,212
You're much uglier
in daylight.

213
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:58,977
What's your name?

214
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,708
I'm Jaime Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

215
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,614
son of Tywin.

216
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:09,358
A captive Knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

217
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,209
Brienne of Tarth.

218
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,087
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

219
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,935
Crescent moons
and starbursts.

220
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,932
Lord... Selwyn Tarth,

221
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:21,675
your father.

222
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:25,667
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, My Lady?

223
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:28,468
It's a long way
to King's Landing.

224
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:31,298
Might as well get
to know one another.

225
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,278
Have you known many men?

226
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:34,729
I suppose not.

227
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,094
Women?

228
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:37,838
Horses?
Ah!

229
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,866
I didn't mean to give offense, My Lady.
Forgive me.

230
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,346
Your crimes are past
forgiveness, Kingslayer.

231
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:45,842
Why do you
hate me so much?

232
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:48,789
- <i>Have I ever harmed you?</i>
- <i>You've harmed others--</i>

233
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:51,358
<i>those you were</i>
<i>sworn to protect,</i>

234
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,294
the weak,
the innocent.

235
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:56,440
Has anyone ever told you you're
as boring as you are ugly?

236
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,083
You will not
provoke me to anger.

237
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,702
I already have.
Look at you.

238
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,989
You're ready
to chop my head off.

239
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,306
Do you think you could?

240
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,142
Do you think you could
beat me in a fair fight?

241
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,076
I've never
seen you fight.

242
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:12,112
The answer is no.

243
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,458
There are three men
in the kingdoms who might

244
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,254
have a chance against me.
You're not one of them.

245
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,287
All my life men like you
have sneered at me.

246
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,421
And all my life I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

247
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,836
If you're so confident,
unlock my chains.

248
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:27,795
Let's see what happens.

249
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,898
Do you take me for an idiot? In.

250
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:35,751
I took you for a fighter,

251
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:39,974
a man-- pardon--
woman of honor.

252
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:42,186
Was I wrong?

253
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:44,038
You're afraid.

254
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:49,284
Maybe one day
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

255
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:04,331
<i>King's Landing</i>
<i>will fall an hour</i>

256
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,050
<i>after Stannis</i>
<i>lands his force.</i>

257
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,936
<i>It's not too late for</i>
<i>King Joffrey and Cersei</i>

258
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:13,117
<i>and the court</i>
<i>to ride west to safety.</i>

259
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,012
Surrender the Iron Throne?

260
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:18,479
Better than seeing their heads
mounted on the city gates.

261
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,786
Stannis will
execute them all.

262
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:24,100
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

263
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,087
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

264
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,006
Stannis, two days
from the capital

265
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,696
and the wolf
at my doorstep.

266
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:36,216
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

267
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,739
The last time the scouts assured us

268
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,530
of Stark's movement,
he lured us into a trap.

269
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,702
<i>Which is why my son</i>
<i>is his prisoner.</i>

270
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,711
<i>Too close</i>
<i>to Casterly Rock.</i>

271
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:56,917
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

272
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:59,153
The Greyjoys have
done us a great favor.

273
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,984
Stark won't risk marching
on Casterly Rock

274
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,836
until he's at full force.

275
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:07,728
He's a boy and he's
never lost a battle.

276
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:10,545
He'll risk anything
at any time

277
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:14,422
<i>because he doesn't know</i>
<i>enough to be afraid.</i>

278
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,141
We'll ride at nightfall.

279
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,303
<i>I want a full night's march before</i>
<i>he knows we're on the move.</i>

280
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:29,981
Clegane, you'll maintain
a Garrison here at Harrenhal.

281
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,518
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

282
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:38,589
The girl has proven
herself a good servant.

283
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,944
<i>She'll stay on with you.</i>

284
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:43,673
<i>See that he doesn't get</i>
<i>drunk in the evenings.</i>

285
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,097
He's poor company
when he's sober,

286
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,800
but he's better
at his work.

287
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,175
You've got some
questions to answer.

288
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,148
<i>Who killed Ser Amory?</i>

289
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,945
- I don't know!
<i>- Give me the name.</i>

290
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,047
- Please!
<i>- Take this one out for the crows.</i>

291
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:07,058
<i>I told you, I don't know.</i>

292
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,116
<i>Please.</i>

293
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,406
Look, it's Yoren's
little cunt.

294
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,681
Used to be a boy,
now it's a girl.

295
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,157
- Where's Jaqen?
- Don't care.

296
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,067
Where's your stick
now, bitch?

297
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:24,535
- I promised to fuck you with it.
<i>- Come on.</i>

298
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,634
<i>Time to kill some wolves.

299
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:37,711
You need sour cherries to make it right.

300
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,040
And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you
break them with a mallet.

301
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,582
That's where the real flavor is.

302
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:44,296
You crush 'em up real fine.

303
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,397
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

304
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,659
Where's Jaqen?

305
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:50,554
- How would I know?
- I need him now.

306
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:53,519
- Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?

307
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:54,856
He's helping me.

308
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,224
- I saw him.
- Where?

309
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,875
Where?

310
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:01,970
Where?! Where?

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,612
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

312
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:07,391
On patrol. Let go of my ears.

313
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,914
What do you want with him anyway?

314
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>Mance is gonna march on the Wall.</i>

315
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:36,507
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

316
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,788
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

317
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:40,624
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

318
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:43,373
How does it feel knowing those men all died

319
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:46,464
so you could skip through the
snow with your little savage girl?

320
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,210
- I didn't.
- I should have known better,

321
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,025
trusting a traitor's bastard.

322
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:57,540
He's not yours to kill, crow.

323
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:22,612
Do you have to do that here?

324
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,717
I like to keep me hands clean.

325
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:29,652
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

326
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:41,478
- You should start wearing the gold cloak.
- I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

327
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,648
You're commander of the City Watch.

328
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:47,264
- You shouldn't be dressed like a common sellsword.
- A cloak slows you down in a fight,

329
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:49,490
makes it hard to move quietly.

330
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:53,238
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

331
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:56,255
Well, you're not sneaking
through alleyways any longer.

332
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:59,153
- You're supposed to stand out.
- We had a deal,

333
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:02,979
- and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
- Fine, fine.

334
00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:06,266
No gold cloak.

335
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,148
What?

336
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:19,144
- What?
- What? Why are you staring at me?

337
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,518
You don't want me cleaning me nails.

338
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,465
You don't want me looking your way.

339
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:24,909
Why am I here?

340
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:28,012
To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.

341
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,509
Stannis will be here any day.

342
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:36,870
And one of these explains how to beat him?

343
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:40,676
<i>"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros"</i>

344
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,341
by Archmaester "Shevelathin."

345
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:45,540
"Shevelatesh."

346
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,309
"Chevalteesh."

347
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:53,461
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

348
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:55,618
My Lord Hand, Commander.

349
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,963
I must compliment you
on the Gold Cloaks' performance

350
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,888
these last few weeks.

351
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:05,002
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

352
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,646
I did not know.

353
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:11,279
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

354
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:14,717
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

355
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:16,732
For questioning?

356
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,199
Uh, no.

357
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,616
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

358
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:24,274
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

359
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:27,307
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

360
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,408
Maybe this part's not in your books.

361
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,970
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,753
Food's worth more than gold.

363
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:39,580
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

364
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,470
Things get bad enough,

365
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,870
the poor start eating each other.

366
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,275
The thieves, they love a siege.

367
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:49,440
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

368
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,101
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

369
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:58,899
Given the circumstances, My Lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

370
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,258
<i>"The Great Sieges of Westeros."</i>

371
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:05,980
Thrilling subject.

372
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,869
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

373
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:17,586
Stannis knows King's Landing.

374
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:20,791
He knows where the walls are strongest

375
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,465
and he knows which gates are weakest.

376
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:28,791
The mud gate.

377
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:34,463
A good ram will batter it down in minutes
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

378
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,133
That's where he'll land.

379
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:39,234
And if Stannis does attack the mud gate,

380
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,074
what is our plan?

381
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,662
We could throw books at his men.

382
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:47,858
- We don't have that many books.
- We don't have that many men, either.

383
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:49,745
What do we have?

384
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,792
Pig shit.

385
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,835
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

386
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:17,149
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

387
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:20,129
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

388
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,626
I can't imagine anything much worse.

389
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:25,456
You lack imagination.

390
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:29,612
Where do you think Jon is right now?

391
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:32,768
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

392
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:35,440
A betting man would go with dead.

393
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:37,697
He's not dead.

394
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,193
No, Jon's a great fighter.

395
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:41,984
Well, he's better than me

396
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,812
and a lot better than you.

397
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:46,566
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

398
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:48,909
So did his father.

399
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:51,460
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.

400
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,408
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

401
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:56,325
Shit ones neither.

402
00:24:57,046 --> 00:25:00,598
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

403
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,849
What in seven hells is that?

404
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,848
The First Men made these marks.

405
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:27,146
Help me with it.

406
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:42,440
Look.

407
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,796
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

408
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:52,012
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

409
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,113
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

410
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:56,078
It's been here a long time.

411
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,396
Oh, must be Dragonglass.

412
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,579
Dragonglass?

413
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,866
The Maesters call it Obsidian.

414
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,364
Why would a brother hide it here?

415
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:15,453
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

416
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,476
Mind where you're going.

417
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,522
I'm sorry. I'll--

418
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,115
where were you?

419
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:39,803
- A man has patrol duty.
- Tywin Lannister was right here

420
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:42,832
- and now he's gone.
- A girl owes one more name.

421
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:45,623
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

422
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:50,427
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

423
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:54,193
A minute, an hour, a month.

424
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:56,474
Death is certain,

425
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,278
the time is not.

426
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:01,668
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

427
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,644
I need him dead right now.

428
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:06,208
This a man cannot do.

429
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:09,212
You promised you'd help me.

430
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:11,424
Help was not promised, lovely girl.

431
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:16,163
Only death. There must be others.
Give a name, any name.

432
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:17,828
And you'll kill them?

433
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:20,437
Anybody?

434
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:28,688
By the seven New Gods and the Old Gods
beyond counting, I swear it.

435
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:32,324
All right.

436
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,809
Jaqen H'ghar.

437
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:48,801
A girl gives a man his own name?

438
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:52,592
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.

439
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:53,725
I'm not joking.

440
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,745
- A man can go kill himself.
- Un-name me.

441
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,275
- No.
- Please?

442
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,844
I'll un-name you.

443
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,916
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

444
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,706
This would require more than one life.

445
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:11,849
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine,

446
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,029
Jaqen H'ghar.

447
00:28:13,728 --> 00:28:15,628
A girl lacks honor.

448
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:24,859
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

449
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:27,998
A girl will obey.

450
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:34,132
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

451
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,520
Thank you, Podrick.

452
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:48,163
Odd little boy.

453
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,494
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

454
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,278
You and Varys both.

455
00:28:55,172 --> 00:28:57,344
Excellent lamprey pie.

456
00:28:57,374 --> 00:29:00,309
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

457
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,366
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

458
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:05,165
An inspiration for the troops.

459
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:07,029
The young king in his shining armor

460
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,652
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

461
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,332
He's only a boy.

462
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,883
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

463
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:15,915
He's not ready.

464
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:17,845
What is he, 17?

465
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,190
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

466
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:24,067
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,

467
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,097
some don't.

468
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:29,971
- His place is not on the battlefield.
- It's not on the throne, either,

469
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,001
sadly for all of us.

470
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:37,097
Do you think I'm an idiot?

471
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:39,419
No, I'd say you possess
above average intelligence.

472
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,749
You shipped off my only daughter.

473
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:45,069
And now you want to send my
eldest son to the battlefield to die.

474
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:47,339
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.

475
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,263
He has the finest armor gold can buy.

476
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,220
He needs to be out there.

477
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,782
The men will fight more fiercely seeing
their king fighting beside them

478
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:58,912
instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

479
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:00,876
Any dessert?

480
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:04,107
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

481
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:07,485
Because he has thousands
of spies in his employ.

482
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,702
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

483
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,432
Because he doesn't have a cock.

484
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,450
Neither do you.

485
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,110
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

486
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,080
You, on the other hand,

487
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:23,077
are as big a fool as every other man.

488
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:26,643
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

489
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:28,673
It's not that little.

490
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:36,714
Why are you smiling?

491
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:38,755
Because I'm happy.

492
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,567
And why are you happy?

493
00:30:44,946 --> 00:30:47,096
Because I have your little whore.

494
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,385
I thought you preferred blondes.

495
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,437
Such a droll little fellow.

496
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,978
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

497
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:58,074
No?

498
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:01,150
Oh, good. Father will be so pleased.

499
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,202
Why do you care who I fuck?

500
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:05,944
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

501
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:07,717
You stole my only daughter,

502
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:09,287
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

503
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,875
This is madness. Stannis will be here
in days. You need me.

504
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,605
For what? Your skill in battle?

505
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:19,621
Pretty thing, your whore.

506
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,825
Lovely body.

507
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,567
The bruises will heal in time.

508
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:27,897
Where did you find her?

509
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:30,682
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

510
00:31:30,712 --> 00:31:34,226
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

511
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:36,927
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

512
00:31:36,957 --> 00:31:39,979
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

513
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,258
Well, you're the expert.

514
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:44,338
Tell me.

515
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:47,465
You don't buy them;

516
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:49,565
You only rent them.

517
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:53,234
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

518
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:55,234
This one you like.

519
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:58,077
You like her very much.

520
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:00,978
Could it be love?

521
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:04,897
Don't worry, she'll be treated
gently enough...

522
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:06,479
unless Joffrey is hurt.

523
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,659
And then every wound
he suffers she'll suffer, too.

524
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:11,907
And if he dies,

525
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:17,614
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

526
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:23,645
And how do I know you haven't
killed her already?

527
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:25,441
Would you like to see her?

528
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:26,932
I thought you might.

529
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:30,084
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

530
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:04,820
I'm sorry they hurt you.

531
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,582
You must be brave.

532
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:15,919
I promise I will free you.

533
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,212
Don't forget me.

534
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:20,842
Never.

535
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,710
I will hurt you for this.

536
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:45,442
A day will come when you
think you're safe and happy

537
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,963
and your joy will turn to ashes
in your mouth.

538
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:52,822
And you will know the debt is paid.

539
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:54,868
Get out.

540
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:07,867
Shae!

541
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,509
I've been waiting all night.

542
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:15,146
What is wrong?

543
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,388
You're beautiful.

544
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:27,752
Then why do you look sad?

545
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:36,057
We have to be more careful.

546
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,337
Don't be afraid.

547
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,267
I can take care of myself.

548
00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:42,471
There are people who want to hurt me.

549
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:45,093
I know. I won't let them.

550
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,723
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

551
00:34:52,328 --> 00:34:54,703
I would kill for you. Do you know that?

552
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:59,926
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

553
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:03,355
You're mine.

554
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,405
I'm yours.

555
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:09,237
Promise me.

556
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:15,767
I'm yours, and you are mine.

557
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,555
<i>Still no word?</i>

558
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:32,271
We've sent a dozen ravens.

559
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,134
None have returned.

560
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:38,230
My bastard is only a few days
from Winterfell.

561
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,318
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

562
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:44,370
- If we storm the castle--
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

563
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:49,453
They're his only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

564
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,716
Send word to your son.

565
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,320
Any Ironborn who surrender
will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

566
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:02,159
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace. Too much--

567
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:05,643
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

568
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,821
He betrayed our cause.

569
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:10,517
He betrayed me.

570
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:14,974
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

571
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:19,287
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

572
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,862
Your pardon, My Lord.

573
00:36:23,076 --> 00:36:24,726
- Your Grace.
- My Lady.

574
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,403
How are you?

575
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:41,502
How am I?

576
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
I've had to arrest my mother.

577
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:46,561
The Lannisters have my sisters.

578
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:51,591
The man I considered my closest friend
has seized my home and my brothers.

579
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:54,378
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

580
00:36:54,408 --> 00:36:57,957
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question.
I'm sorry.

581
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:58,987
No.

582
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,343
Forgive me.

583
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:03,095
You're being kind.

584
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,868
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

585
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:07,048
You're a king.

586
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,800
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

587
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:12,141
What kind do you want to be?

588
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:14,979
I don't know. The good kind.

589
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:23,178
Most kings grew up as princes. They spend
their whole lives preparing for the crown.

590
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,915
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

591
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,985
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

592
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,980
to play the harp and dance the latest steps

593
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,110
and recite Valyrian poetry.

594
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:40,996
- I'd like to hear you play the harp.
- No. No, you would not.

595
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,321
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

596
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,010
to sawing off men's feet?

597
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,857
When I was 12,

598
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:06,054
my mother and father went to a wedding.

599
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,034
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

600
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:11,852
And they left me with my little brother.

601
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,791
The second afternoon they were gone

602
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,821
was the hottest day in the
three-year summer.

603
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,980
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

604
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:25,396
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

605
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:28,919
The rich, the poor, we were all there,

606
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:32,542
naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

607
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:36,172
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

608
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:41,401
I was treading water,

609
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,385
talking to a friend

610
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,670
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

611
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:49,984
I called his name.

612
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:53,823
Then I started screaming his name.

613
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,283
And then I saw him

614
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,390
floating facedown.

615
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:03,431
My heart just...

616
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,085
stopped. I was...

617
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:13,142
I dragged him from the water.

618
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,791
My friend helped me, I think.

619
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,818
I don't even remember.

620
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,011
He was so little.

621
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:26,322
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank...

622
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,877
and I screamed at him

623
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,520
and I shook him

624
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,170
and he was dead.

625
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:37,695
Just dead.

626
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,149
A man ran over.

627
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,264
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

628
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:53,306
In Volantis the slaves have tattoos

629
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:56,214
so you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

630
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,846
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

631
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:00,913
And he pushed me out of the way.

632
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:03,877
You have to understand,

633
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,420
for a slave to push a highborn girl--

634
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,191
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

635
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,743
But he pushed me out of the way

636
00:40:15,471 --> 00:40:19,274
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

637
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:23,433
again and again and again

638
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,526
until my brother spat out

639
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,645
half of the Rhoyne

640
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:35,079
and cried out. And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

641
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,269
I decided two things that day.

642
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,260
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

643
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:52,919
And when I came of age...

644
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:57,828
I would never live in a slave city again.

645
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:08,223
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You told me of your problems and...

646
00:41:08,395 --> 00:41:12,243
- I've blathered on.
- I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

647
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,863
I don't want you to marry her.

648
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,150
But you needed that bridge.

649
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:28,472
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

650
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,342
<i>The sour cherries was
all crushed up and ready.</i>

651
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:37,411
<i>Shut up.</i>

652
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,832
Probably in the piecrust by now.

653
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:40,966
In the oven,

654
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:43,982
- the nice warm oven.
- Shut up.

655
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,860
- What did you bring?
- The cheese could be better.

656
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:52,292
- I did get some nice sausages.
- What did he want us to do about those guards?

657
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:53,572
He didn't say.

658
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:56,903
He just said, "walk through the gates.
What about the guards?

659
00:42:56,933 --> 00:43:00,429
- He didn't say anything about the guards.
- What, he left that bit out?

660
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,699
It's a pretty important part,
don't you think?

661
00:43:02,729 --> 00:43:05,479
- We have to trust him.
- Trust him?

662
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,480
You trusted him to fight with us
and you set him free and he ran.

663
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:10,940
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.

664
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,920
Stay here if you're afraid.

665
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:16,842
Arry, don't.

666
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:48,380
Away! Reset!

667
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,071
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's landing in a day.

668
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:01,451
Will it hold?

669
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:04,981
Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

670
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,220
<i>Again, pull!</i>

671
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,549
I admire you, Ser Davos.

672
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:16,212
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.

673
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,510
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and think they insult you.

674
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,840
So you take the onion for your Sigil,

675
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,350
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

676
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,312
My son wishes me to change it.

677
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:30,772
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

678
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:34,822
I understand why the older
families look down at me.

679
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:36,958
Do you? Why?

680
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:39,922
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

681
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:43,963
Well, sons of Lords don't like to
break bread with sons of crabbers.

682
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:45,540
Our hands stink.

683
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,458
And where were those Lords
when Storm's End starved?

684
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:50,562
Many fought bravely for your brother.

685
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:52,182
Many fought for the Mad King.

686
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,080
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

687
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:59,362
Some are happy to do it to my face.

688
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:01,335
We were forgotten.

689
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:04,271
Robert and Ned Stark--
they were the heroes,

690
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,951
the glorious rebels marching
from battle to battle,

691
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,580
liberating towns from the yoke
of the Mad King

692
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,023
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

693
00:45:13,053 --> 00:45:15,528
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

694
00:45:15,558 --> 00:45:18,999
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

695
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:22,742
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

696
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,552
First we ate the horses.

697
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,393
We weren't riding anyway,
not with the castle surrounded.

698
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:33,502
We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.

699
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:38,593
Then the cats. Never liked cats.
So fine. I do like dogs.

700
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,660
Good animals. Loyal.
But we ate them. Then the rats.

701
00:45:43,442 --> 00:45:46,592
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

702
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:49,922
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

703
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,370
And then you made it through the lines.

704
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,840
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

705
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,628
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

706
00:45:58,658 --> 00:46:00,976
Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

707
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:04,056
I was relieved they did not.

708
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:09,026
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

709
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:12,646
Then he told me he was
giving it to Renly,

710
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:13,914
so I gave it up.

711
00:46:13,944 --> 00:46:16,262
Insult or no, I gave it up

712
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:20,706
because Robert was my older brother and he
was the king and I've always done my duty.

713
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:24,680
But now I'm the rightful king by
every law of Westeros.

714
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,297
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

715
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:31,514
Your Grace...

716
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:36,418
I pray I serve you well.

717
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,447
I expect you'll be the first crabber's
son to wear the badge.

718
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:48,321
You're the master of whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

719
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:51,397
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

720
00:46:51,427 --> 00:46:54,233
I have many little birds in the North, My Lord,

721
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:56,007
but I haven't heard their songs

722
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:58,791
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

723
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:02,421
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

724
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,695
To strike?

725
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,089
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

726
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:11,676
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

727
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:14,035
If my Uncle Stannis lands on
the shores of King's Landing,

728
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,914
I'll ride out to greet him.

729
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:17,793
A brave choice, Your Grace.

730
00:47:17,823 --> 00:47:20,673
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

731
00:47:20,893 --> 00:47:23,143
They say Stannis never smiles.

732
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,080
I'll give him a red smile

733
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:28,143
from ear to ear.

734
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:35,709
Imagine Stannis's terror.

735
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:37,597
I am trying.

736
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:40,986
You're an intelligent man.

737
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:42,601
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

738
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:44,196
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord,

739
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:46,476
not even the multitudes who despise you.

740
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,510
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

741
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,602
I wish we could, too.

742
00:47:53,814 --> 00:47:55,014
What do you want?

743
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,739
Tell me.

744
00:47:57,979 --> 00:47:59,779
If we're going to play,

745
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:01,934
you'll have to start.

746
00:48:06,062 --> 00:48:09,562
My brother was the youngest
Kingsguard in history.

747
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:14,150
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

748
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:17,627
When I reached manhood,

749
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:21,754
my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

750
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:23,727
A most highborn plumber.

751
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:25,793
The water never flowed better.

752
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:28,423
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

753
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:31,534
I never expected to have any real power.

754
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:33,692
So when my father named me acting Hand--

755
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:36,028
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

756
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:38,658
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men,

757
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,126
honorable men,

758
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:43,936
but they disdained the game
and those who played.

759
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:47,066
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

760
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:48,879
Last thing I expected.

761
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:50,299
And you play it well.

762
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,479
I'd like to keep playing it.

763
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:58,201
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

764
00:48:58,231 --> 00:49:00,531
They say he burns his enemies alive

765
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:03,032
to honor the Lord of Light.

766
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:04,802
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

767
00:49:04,832 --> 00:49:07,432
the drowned God wants them drowned.

768
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:10,705
Why are all the Gods such vicious cunts?

769
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:13,085
Where is the God of tits and wine?

770
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:15,155
In the Summer Isles,

771
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,285
they worship a fertility
goddess with 16 teats.

772
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:20,807
We should sail there immediately.

773
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:25,559
This morning I heard a song

774
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:29,678
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

775
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:31,682
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

776
00:49:33,048 --> 00:49:36,277
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

777
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,144
She has three dragons.

778
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,323
But even if what they say is true,

779
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:45,158
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

780
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:49,135
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

781
00:49:49,692 --> 00:49:51,742
One game at a time, my friend.

782
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:03,236
Careful, Khaleesi.

783
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:08,220
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have
1,000 eyes watching for you.

784
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:11,263
I found one--

785
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:14,247
a ship with a good captain.

786
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:16,975
- She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
- Astapor?

787
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:19,068
We cannot stay here.

788
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:22,256
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.

789
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,786
They're not your children.

790
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:27,128
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons

791
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,670
and I know you love them, but you
didn't grow them in your womb.

792
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,711
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

793
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:34,836
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

794
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:38,666
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

795
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:42,572
You know I would die for you.

796
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:45,665
I will never abandon you.

797
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:50,001
- I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
- Then serve me.

798
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:54,155
If my dragons are in the House of the Undying,
then take me there.

799
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,116
That's what the warlock wants.

800
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:57,596
He told you so himself.

801
00:50:57,848 --> 00:51:00,641
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

802
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:03,621
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

803
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:06,881
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

804
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:10,975
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

805
00:51:12,142 --> 00:51:15,407
Until my last breath I will remember.

806
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:20,341
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

807
00:51:24,487 --> 00:51:26,087
They are my children.

808
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:31,545
And they are the only children
I will ever have.

809
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:38,403
Take me to them.

810
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:52,626
We should bury them.

811
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:55,730
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.

812
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,510
Sends a message.

813
00:51:57,956 --> 00:52:01,348
If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

814
00:52:01,378 --> 00:52:02,378
As you say.

815
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,558
But it don't hurt to let 'em
rot a while longer.

816
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:08,926
- What's this?
- Gold...

817
00:52:09,198 --> 00:52:10,412
for the farmer.

818
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:12,734
For his trouble.

819
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,169
His troubles are done.

820
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:17,443
He's feeding the crops now.

821
00:52:17,956 --> 00:52:19,506
His wife, too.

822
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,046
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

823
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:47,551
<i>Got as far as the farm
and then doubled back.</i>

824
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:52,432
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

825
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:58,801
Hoped this would be the
last place they'd think to look.

826
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,520
You're right...

827
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:02,904
so far.

828
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:06,483
Who was that out there

829
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:09,043
hung up the gates?

830
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:12,452
Must have been the farmer's boys.

831
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:15,779
He killed them and burned them

832
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:20,701
and passed them off as the little lords?

833
00:53:21,773 --> 00:53:23,473
<i>They mustn't know.</i>

834
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:27,016
<i>Bran would blame himself.</i>

835
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:29,503
<i>They'll never hear it from me.</i>

836
00:53:30,828 --> 00:53:33,428
<i>The little lads have suffered enough.</i>

837
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:44,274
