1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,162
<i>Previously on Game of Thrones...
Tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.</i>

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05,439
I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

3
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:07,065
If Renly sides with us,

4
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,678
we'll outnumber them two to one.

5
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,779
I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,388
But I am very good at keeping
secrets for my good friends.

7
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:18,416
Your discretion is legendary.

8
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:21,251
You in command here?
I have a royal warrant,...

9
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,955
<i>for one of these gutter
rats you're transporting.<i>

10
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:26,994
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

11
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:29,032
<i>We'll be back with more men.<i>

12
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,209
This is Gilly.
She's one of Craster's daughters.

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,421
We have to take her with us when we leave.

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,516
I'm going to have a baby.
If it's a boy...

15
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,568
If it's a boy, what?

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,374
Seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King,
well, I just wouldn't feel safe,...

17
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:43,732
with you lurking about.

18
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:46,012
- The queen herself...
- The queen regent.

19
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,298
And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.

20
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:50,040
<i>I hope you enjoy the Wall.</i>

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,794
<i>I have friends at court!</i>

22
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,312
To the new Commander.

23
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:55,612
- I need to get to Pyke.
- I'm heading that way,...

24
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:56,904
Lord Greyjoy.

25
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,397
<i>I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him</i>

26
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,448
<i>and he will make me king of
the Iron Islands</i> once again.

27
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:05,261
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

28
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,771
I'm your son, who else?

29
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,266
- Yara?
- So good to see you, brother.

30
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:11,728
- She can't lead an attack.
- She's commanded men.

31
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,300
She's killed men.

32
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,738
No man gives me a crown.
I will take my crown.

37
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:27,993
Out,...

38
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,852
All of you.

39
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:34,480
Bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!

40
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:36,517
I want you,...

41
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:38,170
and your men,...

42
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:40,494
gone.

43
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,263
And you will make this right.

44
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,218
- Wait outside.
- Lord Commander.

45
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:50,278
Now!

46
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,333
- Lord Commander.
- Leave us.

47
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:16,636
What did you do?

48
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:18,914
I followed him.

49
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:22,238
He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.

50
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:25,265
- What business is that of yours?
- No, you don't understand.

51
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,431
He's killing them, all the boys.

52
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:34,911
You know.

53
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:40,068
The wildlings,...

54
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,157
serve crueler Gods than you or I.

55
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,955
Those boys,...

56
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,404
- are Craster's offerings.
- Offerings?

57
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,684
He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.

58
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:55,450
Aye, many a time that monster has
been the difference between life and death,...

59
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,818
for our rangers.

60
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,527
Your uncle among them.

61
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,574
We have other wars to fight out there.

62
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,903
Like it or not,

63
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,038
we need men like Craster.

64
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:13,525
I...

65
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,417
I saw it.

66
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:19,770
I saw,...

67
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,348
something take that child.

68
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:26,332
Yeah.

69
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,229
Whatever it was,

70
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,780
I daresay you'll see it again.

71
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,760
Now,...

72
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:36,774
ready my horse.

73
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,395
We leave at dawn.

74
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:45,768
Don't lose it again.

75
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:11,508
Gilly.

76
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,402
You're leaving.

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
I...

78
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,834
I wanted to give you something.

79
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,349
It belonged to my mother.

80
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,906
- I can't take it.
- Please.

81
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:32,783
I want you to.

82
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,429
My mother used it for sewing.

83
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:42,604
She'd let me sit with her
in her chamber while she sewed

84
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:44,930
and I'd read to her.

85
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:50,277
My father put a stop to it when he found out.

86
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,136
It's the only thing I have of hers.

87
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,846
She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

88
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,161
You...

89
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,904
You shouldn't give it away.

90
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,638
I'm not giving it away.

91
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,917
I'm giving it to you.

92
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,379
Keep it safe for me.

93
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:13,838
Till I come back.

94
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:33,335
Hodor.

95
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,979
Hodor.

96
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,613
Rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

97
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:12,980
<i>Every night it's the same.</i>

98
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:15,897
I'm walking,...

99
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,365
and running, but...

100
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:21,972
I'm not...

101
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,802
I'm not me.

102
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:28,412
I'm running through the godswood,
sniffing the dirt,...

103
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:32,544
tasting blood in my mouth when
I've made a fresh kill,...

104
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:34,940
howling.

105
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,817
Old Nan used to tell me stories
about magical people who could live

106
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,494
inside stags,...

107
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:45,076
birds,...

108
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,491
wolves.

109
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,950
That's exactly what they are, Bran.

110
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:51,054
- Stories.
<i>- So she was lying?</i>

111
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:54,195
<i>- They don't exist?</i>
- Well, they may have done.

112
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,808
But they're gone from the world

113
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,242
along with much else.

114
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,259
These are dreams, Bran,

115
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,690
- nothing more.
- No,...

116
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,977
My dreams are different.

117
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,402
Mine are true.

118
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,809
I dreamt of my father dying.

119
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,941
And Rickon had the same dream.

120
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,020
What about all the dreams
you had that didn't come true?

121
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,841
Right.

122
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:30,549
This link is made of Valyrian steel.

123
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:34,984
Only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain.

124
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:39,016
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

125
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:44,057
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

126
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,586
I was no different.

127
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,371
I was young.

128
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:49,718
And what boy doesn't,...

129
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:52,630
secretly wish for hidden powers,...

130
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,561
to lift him out of his
dull life into a special one?

131
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,200
But in the end, for all my efforts,

132
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,252
I got no more out of it than 1,000 boys before me.

133
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,311
Come on.

134
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:15,233
All right.

135
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:20,922
Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.

136
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,092
But not anymore.

137
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:27,926
The Dragons are gone.

138
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,121
The Giants are dead.

139
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:35,390
And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

140
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,694
Loras! Highgarden!

141
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,726
<i>Get him!</i>

142
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:42,408
Yield!

143
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,798
I yield.

144
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,405
Well fought.
Approach.

145
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,850
Rise.
Remove your helm.

146
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,677
You are all your father
promised and more, My Lady.

147
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:21,717
I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but,...

148
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,382
never quite in that fashion.

149
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,988
Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.

150
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,407
That he did, my Queen.

151
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:33,194
But there can only be one champion.

152
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:35,698
Brienne of Tarth,

153
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,715
you may ask anything of me you desire.

154
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:40,839
If it is within my power, it is yours.

155
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,620
Your Grace,

156
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:47,482
I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

157
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:49,211
<i>What?</i>

158
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:52,360
<i>I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,</i>

159
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,898
and keep you safe from all harm.

160
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,321
Done.

161
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:03,506
Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

162
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:15,751
Your Grace, I have the honor to
bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

163
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,969
sent as an envoy by her son Robb,
Lord of Winterfell.

164
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,524
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

165
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:25,423
Lady Catelyn.
I'm pleased to see you.

166
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,665
May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell?!

167
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,203
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

168
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,339
I'm so sorry for your loss.

169
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:38,209
You are most kind.

170
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,862
<i>My Lady,</i>

171
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:44,983
<i>I swear to you I will see the Lannisters
answer for your husband's murder.</i>

172
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:48,117
When I take King's Landing,

173
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,945
I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

174
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:02,529
It will be enough to know that
justice was done, My Lord.

175
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,566
Your Grace.

176
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,969
And you should kneel when you approach the king.

177
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:10,372
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

178
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,348
Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?

179
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:16,851
I do not sit on my son's war councils.

180
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:20,784
And if I did, I would not share his
strategies with you.

181
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:24,089
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

182
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,999
not hide behind his mother's skirts.

183
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,858
My son is fighting a war,

184
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,793
not playing at one.

185
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,974
Don't worry, My Lady.

186
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,353
Our war is just beginning.

187
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,491
- Your Grace.
<i>- Gerard.</i>

188
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:06,160
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

189
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,495
They don't know their own size is all.

190
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,037
Good man.

191
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,534
I have 100,000 men at my command.

192
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:17,174
All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.

193
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,574
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

194
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,758
It's a game to you, isn't it?

195
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,580
- I pity them.
- Why?

196
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,482
Because it won't last.

197
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:32,244
Because they are the knights of
summer and winter is coming.

198
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:35,382
Brienne,...

199
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:38,461
escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

200
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:41,498
- She's tired from her journey.
<i>- At once, Your Grace.</i>

201
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:43,767
- Shall I return after?
- That won't be necessary.

202
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:46,960
I would pray awhile.
Alone.

203
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,866
If you'll follow me, My Lady.

204
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:56,079
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

205
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:58,481
I fought for my king.

206
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:01,581
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

207
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,886
Die for him if I must.

208
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:07,589
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

209
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:10,326
I'm no lady.

210
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,909
What are you doing here?

211
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,133
I live here.

212
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,679
Are you angry with me, brother?

213
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,154
You lying bitch.

214
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:53,037
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

215
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,307
Recognize you?
How could I?

216
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,209
The last time I saw you...

217
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,371
You looked like a fat little boy.

218
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,416
You were a fat little boy, too,

219
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,986
but I recognized you.

220
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,459
Why didn't you tell me?

221
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,729
I wanted to see who you were first.

222
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,559
And I did.

223
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,628
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

224
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,414
- Father.
- Father.

225
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:25,443
The wolf pup has gone south,...

226
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,610
with the entirety of the
northern army at his back.

227
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,482
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

228
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:34,246
the north is ripe for the taking.

229
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,887
The Ironborn will reave and
pillage as it was in the old days,...

230
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,918
all along the northern coast.

231
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,989
We'll spread our dominion across the green lands,

232
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,080
securing the Neck and everything above.

233
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,829
Every stronghold will yield to us one by one.

234
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:51,736
Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?

235
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,568
The rest shall be ours,...

236
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:56,657
forest, field and hall.

237
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:05,915
Yara, my daughter, you'll take
30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte.

238
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,017
I've always wanted a castle.

239
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:09,981
And what's my role in all this?

240
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:15,647
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

241
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,626
A ship?

242
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,695
You give her 30 and I get one?

243
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,232
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

244
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,969
I'm to fight fishermen?

245
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,273
Be careful of their nets.

246
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:36,444
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

247
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,417
He won't give up the North so easily.

248
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,256
They won't even know we're
there until it's too late.

249
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,586
What do you know of it, woman?

250
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,359
I'm a proven warrior.

251
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,491
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead,...

252
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:50,161
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

253
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:53,664
I'm not protecting anyone.

254
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:55,971
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.

255
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,067
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

256
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,372
Rise up against them and they could destroy us.

257
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:05,118
But if we pledge fealty to them,

258
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:08,550
- they'll give us Casterly Rock.
- What are our words?

259
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:11,721
Our words?

260
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,273
- "We do not sow."
- "We do not sow."

261
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:18,941
We are Ironborn.

262
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,535
We're not subjects.
We're not slaves.

263
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:24,742
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.

264
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,922
We take what is ours.

265
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,190
Your time with the wolves has made you weak.

266
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:38,481
You act as if I volunteered to go.

267
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,171
You gave me away, if you remember.

268
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,466
The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon...
After he crushed you.

269
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:47,746
Did you take what was yours then?

270
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,441
You gave me away!

271
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:55,637
Your boy!

272
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,396
Your last boy!

273
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:02,918
You gave me away like I was some dog
you didn't want anymore.

274
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:05,962
And now you curse me because I've come home.

275
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:19,549
You'd have our father bow
down to your other family?

276
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:21,878
I have no other family.

277
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,070
Don't you?

278
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,843
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

279
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,623
Our ships sail with or without you.

280
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,341
You won't let me leave this room.
You won't let me...

281
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:46,671
Keep your voice down.

282
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,898
Why? You think your father can hear me?

283
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,715
He's 300 miles away!

284
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,245
I don't intend for you to stay here.

285
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:04,884
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

286
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:07,114
Again, only temporary.

287
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,211
Every man who has tasted my cooking

288
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:12,752
has told me what a good whore I am.

289
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:14,532
But you wouldn't be a cook.

290
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:16,801
You'd pose as a scullion.

291
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:20,998
Scullion? What is a scullion?

292
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:23,585
Kitchen wench.

293
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,515
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but...

294
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,242
Cleaning pots?

295
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:31,052
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

296
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,185
Your lion wants to see you alive.

297
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:35,950
We've come to a dangerous place.

298
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,812
My sister wants to hurt me.

299
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:39,962
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

300
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:42,030
She can't know about you.

301
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,191
I'm the weakness?

302
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,254
It's a compliment, My Lady.

303
00:21:46,284 --> 00:21:49,484
How is being a weakness a compliment?

304
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,133
Language can be a bit tricky here.

305
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:59,832
I'm too stupid to understand.
The stupid foreign girl.

306
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,784
I am not a kitchen wench.

307
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:33,511
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

308
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:36,470
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

309
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,100
Mother says I'll have a new gown for
the ceremony and another for the feast.

310
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:44,573
But yours will be ivory,
since you're the bride.

311
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:51,019
The Princess just spoke to you.

312
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,049
Pardon, Your Grace.

313
00:22:55,392 --> 00:22:58,411
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

314
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:01,190
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done,...

315
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,917
and I can pledge my love to
the king in sight of the Gods.

316
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,430
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

317
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:15,585
He might.

318
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,170
Would you like that?

319
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:24,038
No. I don't think so.

320
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:29,135
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

321
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,869
Won't you, little dove?

322
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Come in.

323
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:57,782
Who are you?

324
00:23:58,157 --> 00:24:01,107
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

325
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,743
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

326
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,356
- You're not from here.
- No.

327
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:16,501
What are you doing?

328
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:18,442
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

329
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:22,027
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.

330
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,170
What things?

331
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:27,908
Change my linens,
wash my clothing, scrub the floor,

332
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:31,138
empty my chamber pot,
brush my hair.

333
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,377
- No.
- You said to brush...

334
00:24:41,407 --> 00:24:42,501
Not now.

335
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,223
Your chamber pot is empty.

336
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:50,410
Clean the table.

337
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:58,235
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

338
00:24:58,943 --> 00:25:00,301
- Yes.
- For whom?

339
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:02,552
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

340
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:06,112
Lady Zuriff.

341
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,023
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

342
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:12,329
She wasn't in this city.

343
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:14,543
Well, I don't know how
they did things in that city,

344
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:18,923
but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,
not the other way around.

345
00:25:19,098 --> 00:25:24,048
And I don't have time to answer 1,000
questions and teach you how to do your job.

346
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,533
Do you want me to leave?

347
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:39,082
Just brush my hair.

348
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:55,964
Thank the Gods.

349
00:25:56,552 --> 00:25:59,342
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

350
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:01,810
I've encountered this problem before, My Lord.

351
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,481
The stresses of power often have this,...

352
00:26:05,592 --> 00:26:07,359
insalubrious effect.

353
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:10,270
Two drops with water daily.

354
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,880
Right. I'm so grateful to have
a man of your vast,...

355
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,463
knowledge and wisdom on my side.

356
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:17,893
- Please.
- Thank you, My Lord.

357
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:26,731
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
Why, yes, of course, My Lord.

358
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:28,713
These are perilous times.

359
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:31,723
And the crown must forge new alliances.

360
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,516
And these alliances,...

361
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,530
must often be sealed in matrimony.

362
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,607
Matrimony, huh?

363
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
Yes.

364
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:45,264
I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the queen mustn't know.

365
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,667
We can't have her meddling in affairs
that could determine the future of the realm.

366
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:52,737
<b>There's too much at stake.
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.

367
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,631
I shall be silent as the grave.

368
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,985
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

369
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:04,388
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
when she comes of age,

370
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:08,715
ensuring their loyalty
and their army should we need it.

371
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:09,972
Myrcella...

372
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,414
sent away to Dorne?

373
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:17,631
But remember, the queen mustn't know.

374
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:21,093
"The queen mustn't know."

375
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:24,562
I love conversations that begin this way.

376
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:28,184
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off

377
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,414
to Theon Greyjoy.

378
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:32,705
Theon Greyjoy?

379
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,250
Forgive me, My Lord, but how?

380
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:39,002
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

381
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:41,609
- He fights for Robb Stark.
- Precisely.

382
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,240
Theon's father loathes the Starks

383
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,796
and will convince the boy
to come to our side.

384
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:50,378
Greyjoy can destroy the northern
army from within

385
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:53,140
and we can have his father's ships.

386
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:56,284
But remember, you must tell no one.

387
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:59,461
Tell no one what?

388
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:03,354
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
Robin Arryn of the Vale.

389
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,875
Lysa...

390
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:08,090
is not fond of me.

391
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,600
But perhaps the promise of a royal match
will convince her to

392
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,874
let bygones be bygones.

393
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:15,705
She imprisoned you.

394
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:17,999
She tried to execute you.

395
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:20,859
And you offer her son a princess?

396
00:28:21,263 --> 00:28:22,999
For men in our position,

397
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:27,029
holding grudges can be
an encumbrance, don't you think?

398
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,991
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

399
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:32,584
Who better?

400
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,253
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,

401
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:40,613
if I cared to.

402
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,131
What's in it for me?

403
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,710
The gratitude of the people of Westeros

404
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,646
for helping to end this war,

405
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:53,256
the adoration of the King for
bringing the Vale back into the fold...

406
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,766
and Harrenhal.

407
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,557
Harrenhal is cursed.

408
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,753
Never took you for a superstitious man.

409
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:05,489
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You'll be able to afford it.

410
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:08,325
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

411
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:13,201
With a single stroke, you'd make me one
of the greatest lords in the realm.

412
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:16,363
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

413
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:19,721
So did Janos Slynt, and he
was given Harrenhal, too.

414
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:21,664
Until you snatched it away.

415
00:29:22,204 --> 00:29:24,972
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.

416
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:27,432
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

417
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:31,458
It's settled, then?

418
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:35,162
Good.

419
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:39,298
Oh, and remember--

420
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:41,108
the queen mustn't know.

421
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,868
That must hurt.

422
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:33,694
What?

423
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,169
What is it?

424
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:41,162
A member of the Kingsguard?

425
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,604
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

426
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:51,050
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

427
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,150
And she's devoted to me.

428
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,183
You're jealous.

429
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,481
Jealous?

430
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:03,157
Of Brienne the Beauty?

431
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,598
Don't make me laugh.

432
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,123
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

433
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:13,353
Not tonight.

434
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:17,082
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

435
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:21,172
You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.

436
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,010
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

437
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:41,992
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

438
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,852
And Margaery's a virgin?

439
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,271
Officially.

440
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:48,437
Shall I bring her to you?

441
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,416
I should warn you,

442
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,513
I've had quite a bit of wine.

443
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,525
As is your right. You are a King.

444
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,650
You look very beautiful.

445
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:28,167
Thank you, Your Grace.

446
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:30,565
It's a lovely gown.

447
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:31,925
You think so?

448
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,909
I can't decide how I like it better.

449
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,919
This way...

450
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:37,907
or...

451
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:39,867
this way.

452
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:47,872
You certainly don't need it.

453
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:50,492
Although...

454
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,827
some say that beauty most desired is...

455
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:56,899
the beauty concealed.

456
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,950
Must be the wine.

457
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,696
Here, let me.

458
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:38,705
I'm sorry.

459
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:42,391
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

460
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,224
What?

461
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:48,617
He could get you started.
I know he wouldn't mind.

462
00:33:48,642 --> 00:33:51,221
Or I can turn over and
you can pretend I'm him.

463
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,854
I don't know what you're talking about.

464
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,720
There's no need for us to play games.

465
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:07,629
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

466
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,761
Your enemies aren't happy about us.

467
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,825
They want to tear us apart.

468
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,552
And the best way to stop them

469
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:36,217
is to put your baby

470
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,949
in my belly.

471
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,017
We can try again later.

472
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:49,166
You decide how you want to do it--
with me, with me and Loras.

473
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:51,149
However else you like.

474
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,859
Whatever you need to do.

475
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,198
You are a King.

476
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,411
You monster.

477
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:15,153
Myrcella is my only daughter.

478
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:17,909
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

479
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,458
Myrcella's a Princess.

480
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:20,965
Some would say she was born for this.

481
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:24,919
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

482
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,254
Dorne is the safest place or her.

483
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,691
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

484
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:32,775
That's why we need to seduce them.

485
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:36,681
We're going to need their support in the war
your son started.

486
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,911
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

487
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,729
You won't get away with this.

488
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:45,806
You think the piece of paper father
gave you keeps you safe.

489
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,312
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

490
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:55,228
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

491
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,682
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

492
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,338
Just how safe do you think
Myrcella is if this city falls?

493
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,856
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

494
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:11,040
Make no mistake.

495
00:36:11,286 --> 00:36:14,032
They'll mount her pretty little head
on a spike right beside yours.

496
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:16,196
Get out! Get out!

497
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:20,813
Theon of the House Greyjoy,

498
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:24,602
you would this day consecrate
your faith to the Drowned God?

499
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:34,220
I would.

500
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:35,607
Kneel.

501
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:43,139
Let Theon, your servant,
be born again from the sea as you were.

502
00:37:43,815 --> 00:37:45,561
Bless him with salt.

503
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,204
Bless him with stone.

504
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:53,587
Bless him with steel.

505
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:00,364
What is dead may never die.

506
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,332
What is dead may never die...

507
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,363
But rises again harder and stronger.

508
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,487
Stand.

509
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,157
I don't appreciate being
made a fool of, dwarf.

510
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:44,558
If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,

511
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:47,134
she can't very well marry
Robin Arryn, can she?

512
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:50,082
No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

513
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,285
And Harrenhal--

514
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:53,295
I suppose...

515
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:55,112
that's off the table as well.

516
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:57,306
Yes, I fear so.

517
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,767
Sorry about that, too.

518
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,403
Leave me out of your next deception.

519
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:03,072
That's a shame.

520
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,793
You were to be the centerpiece of
my next deception.

521
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,193
My brother Jaime rots
in a Northern stockade.

522
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,848
I would see him released.

523
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:13,423
That's where you come in.

524
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:15,921
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

525
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,397
No, he won't.

526
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:20,098
But his mother might.

527
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:23,175
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

528
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:28,230
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

529
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,335
And he has company.

530
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,576
Filthy old stoat.
Almost hate to interrupt.

531
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:38,044
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

532
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,227
What is the meaning of this?

533
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:49,690
No, please, please.

534
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:52,085
You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

535
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,279
I am your loyal servant.

536
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,843
So loyal that you told the Queen
about my plans

537
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:58,250
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

538
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:00,146
No! Never!

539
00:40:00,176 --> 00:40:02,448
It's a falsehood. I swear it.

540
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:04,247
It wasn't me.

541
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,351
Ah, Varys.

542
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:09,209
It was Varys the spider.

543
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,223
See, I told Varys that I was giving
the Princess to the Greyjoys.

544
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:17,677
I told Littlefinger that I planned
to wed her to Robin Arryn.

545
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:21,811
I told no one that I was
offering her to the Dornish.

546
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,499
No one but you.

547
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:26,571
The eunuch has spies everywhere.

548
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,029
Cut off his manhood and
feed it to the goats.

549
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:31,498
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

550
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:33,408
Well, make do.

551
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,801
How long have you been
spying for my sister?

552
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:40,608
All I did, I did for House Lannister.

553
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:43,081
Always. Your lord father, ask him.

554
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:46,777
I've always been his servant
since the days of the Mad King.

555
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,690
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

556
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:53,313
What? Oh, no. No.

557
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:59,663
How many hands have you
betrayed, Pycelle?

558
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,548
Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

559
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,865
Lord Arryn, he knew.

560
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,870
He knew the truth about the queen.

561
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:08,087
And...

562
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,482
well, he planned to act,

563
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,487
to tell King Robert.

564
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,142
So you poisoned him?

565
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:16,111
No. Never.

566
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:18,929
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

567
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,790
Lannister-- I always served Lannister.

568
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,251
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

569
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:26,097
Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please.

570
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:28,624
Don't! You can't do this to me!

571
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:31,226
For your trouble.

572
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:58,129
You'll be pleased to know
our mutual friend

573
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:01,234
is doing quite well
in Lady Sansa's service.

574
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,889
Good. One of my better ideas.

575
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:09,977
And it seems the Grand Maester
has found his way into a black cell.

576
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,909
Well played, My Lord Hand.

577
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:17,822
But should I be worried?

578
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,635
Janos Slynt, Pycelle--

579
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:22,558
the small council grows
smaller every day.

580
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:26,131
The council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

581
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:28,809
I don't mean to follow
Ned Stark to the grave.

582
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:32,611
Power is a curious thing, My Lord.

583
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:35,553
Are you fond of riddles?

584
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:37,564
Why, am I about to hear one?

585
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,856
Three great men sit in a room.

586
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:42,437
A king, a priest and a rich man.

587
00:42:43,088 --> 00:42:45,453
Between them stands a common sellsword.

588
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:49,426
Each great man bids the
sellsword kill the other two.

589
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:51,792
Who lives, who dies?

590
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:54,688
Depends on the sellsword.

591
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:59,005
Does it? He has neither crown
nor gold nor favor with the Gods.

592
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:01,227
He has a sword, the power of life and death.

593
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,175
But if it's swordsmen who rule,

594
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:05,985
why do we pretend kings
hold all the power?

595
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:08,541
When Ned Stark lost his head,

596
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:10,735
who was truly responsible?

597
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:12,601
Joffrey?

598
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,809
The executioner?

599
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:15,416
Or something else?

600
00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:17,421
I've decided I don't like riddles.

601
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:24,591
Power resides where men
believe it resides.

602
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:27,243
It's a trick,

603
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:28,740
a shadow on the wall.

604
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:31,232
And...

605
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,717
a very small man

606
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,282
can cast a very large shadow.

607
00:44:16,408 --> 00:44:17,904
You should be sleeping.

608
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,879
Tomorrow's a long march.

609
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,177
30 miles if it don't piss on us.

610
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:28,033
I can't sleep.

611
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,231
I don't like the taste.

612
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:38,505
Well...

613
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:44,027
You don't drink it for the flavor,
to be honest.

614
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:52,864
What?

615
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:55,798
How do you sleep?

616
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,988
Same as most men, I think.

617
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:01,971
But you've seen things,

618
00:45:02,893 --> 00:45:04,346
horrible things.

619
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:06,467
<i>Aye.</i>

620
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,622
I've seen some pretty things, too, but...

621
00:45:10,754 --> 00:45:12,646
not nearly so many.

622
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,162
How do you sleep when you--

623
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:22,745
when you have those...
things... in your head?

624
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:26,612
You didn't see that.

625
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:29,092
I made damn sure.

626
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:31,492
I close my eyes and I see them up there.

627
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,264
All of them

628
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:36,578
standing there--

629
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,330
Joffrey,

630
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,698
the Queen,

631
00:45:43,193 --> 00:45:44,193
and...

632
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:47,332
and my sister.

633
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,671
You know...

634
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:02,668
we've got something in common,
me and you. You know that?

635
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,588
I must have been

636
00:46:06,184 --> 00:46:07,984
a couple of years older than you.

637
00:46:10,424 --> 00:46:14,794
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart
right on our doorstep.

638
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:18,088
He weren't much of a villain
what skewered him.

639
00:46:18,686 --> 00:46:20,621
Willem, the lad's name was.

640
00:46:22,536 --> 00:46:25,832
He ran off before anyone could spit.

641
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:27,754
And I just stood there,

642
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:31,286
watching my brother die.

643
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,546
But here's the funny part.

644
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:39,182
I can't picture my brother's face anymore.

645
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,494
But Willem--

646
00:46:41,982 --> 00:46:44,283
oh, he was a nice-looking boy.

647
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:48,214
He had good white teeth,

648
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:50,155
blue eyes,

649
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:55,025
one of those dimpled chins
all the girls like.

650
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,335
I would think about him
when I was working,

651
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:02,580
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

652
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:05,723
It got to the point

653
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:10,471
where I would say his name every night
before I went to bed. Willem.

654
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,011
Willem.

655
00:47:12,405 --> 00:47:13,405
Willem.

656
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:16,622
A prayer almost.

657
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,330
Well, one day...

658
00:47:22,864 --> 00:47:25,364
Willem came riding back into town.

659
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:33,051
I buried an ax so deep
into Willem's skull,

660
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:35,321
they had to bury him with it.

661
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:43,500
Willem's horse got me to the Wall
and I've been wearing black ever since.

662
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:48,238
Well...

663
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,032
that'll help you sleep, eh?

664
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,417
Ho!

665
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,609
Get up, you lazy sons of whores!

666
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:04,109
Arm yourselves.

667
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:07,358
- Get up.
- Get up.

668
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:09,547
Keep out of sight, both of you.

669
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:10,648
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

670
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:12,577
Keep out of sight.

671
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:16,442
If things go wrong, you run.
Do you hear me?

672
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,943
You run along North and don't look back.

673
00:48:21,286 --> 00:48:24,613
There's men out there
who want to fuck your corpses.

674
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:26,665
Outside, now!

675
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,995
<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

676
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:34,416
<i>Gold Cloaks!</i>

677
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:41,733
<i>Everyone out!</i>

678
00:48:46,098 --> 00:48:49,612
<i>Hey, you! Open the damn cage!</i>

679
00:48:52,816 --> 00:48:54,352
Where's the bastard, Crow?

680
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:56,990
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

681
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,244
Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman
to Lord Tywin Lannister.

682
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:04,028
These men from the capital
requested our assistance.

683
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:06,477
Drop your weapons in the name of the King.

684
00:49:06,631 --> 00:49:08,175
Now, which King would that be?

685
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:10,213
This is your last chance.

686
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:12,729
In the name of King Joffrey,

687
00:49:13,526 --> 00:49:15,070
drop your weapons.

688
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:20,820
I don't think I will.

689
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:21,989
So be it.

690
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,664
I always hated crossbows.

691
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:29,743
Take too long to load.

692
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:09,307
<i>Boy, come here. Boy!</i>

693
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:12,009
<i>- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!</i>

694
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:14,263
Help us, boy!

695
00:50:18,214 --> 00:50:19,799
A man can fight!

696
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:20,829
Free us!

697
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:29,282
Quick, give it to me.

698
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,654
Give me the ax. Give me that.

699
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:43,668
<i>Put 'em on the wagon!</i>

700
00:50:44,865 --> 00:50:46,765
<i>There's more here. Come on.</i>

701
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:53,167
What do we have here?

702
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:56,325
No!

703
00:50:57,402 --> 00:50:59,598
That's a fine little blade.

704
00:51:01,332 --> 00:51:02,974
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

705
00:51:03,004 --> 00:51:04,504
I yield! I yield!

706
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:06,299
Round up any survivors.

707
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:08,886
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

708
00:51:09,282 --> 00:51:11,174
You heard him. You're coming with us.

709
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:13,804
I yield!

710
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:20,846
Help!

711
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:21,909
Help me!

712
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:28,467
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

713
00:51:28,497 --> 00:51:29,497
Look at it.

714
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,523
Can you walk?

715
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,900
No. You got to carry me.

716
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:44,756
All right.

717
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,285
Carry him, he says.

718
00:52:10,322 --> 00:52:12,736
We're looking for a bastard
named Gendry.

719
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:14,746
Give him up

720
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,767
or I'll start taking eyeballs.

721
00:52:30,936 --> 00:52:32,350
You want Gendry?

722
00:52:36,091 --> 00:52:37,505
You already got him.

723
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:43,804
He loved that helmet.

724
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:51,974
