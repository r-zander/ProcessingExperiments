00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:00,393
My name

3
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:03,062
is Grey Worm.

4
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,732
I come from

5
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,819
the Summer "Ills."

6
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,604
Isles.

7
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:14,740
Summer Isles.

8
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:17,994
<i>Summer Isles.</i>

9
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:28,287
I am from an island
called Naath.

10
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,875
When they took you?

11
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:36,095
<i>"When</i> did<i> they take me?"</i>

12
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,384
I was five years old.

13
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,552
You remember your home?

14
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,857
I remember when they
rowed us away from shore.

15
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:53,396
How white the beaches were.

16
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,066
How tall the trees.

17
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:03,239
And I remember
my village burning.

18
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,792
Smoke rising into the sky.

19
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,419
Do you remember your home?

20
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:19,672
Unsullied.

21
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:22,258
Always Unsullied.

22
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,594
Before Unsullied, nothing.

23
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,897
That's not true.

24
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,601
Perhaps one day you will
return to the Summer Isles.

25
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,437
I don't want return.

26
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,277
Kill the masters.

27
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,913
Kill the masters.

28
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:47,450
<i>How are the lessons coming?</i>

29
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:50,419
Very well, Your Grace.

30
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:53,839
Missandei is teacher
good, my queen.

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,677
You'll have to continue later.

32
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,631

<i>Remind me, Ser Jorah,</i>

70
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:46,665
<i>how many children did the Great
Masters nail to mileposts?</i>

71
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:50,002
163, Khaleesi.

72
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,054
Yes, that was it.

73
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,348
<i>Your Grace,
may I have a word?</i>

74
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,239
The city is yours.

75
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:13,075
<i>All these people,</i>
<i>they're your subjects now.</i>

76
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:16,779
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice

77
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,614
with mercy.

78
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:22,785
I will answer injustice
with justice.

79
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,282
What the hell was that?

80
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,785
That was me knocking
your ass to the dirt

81
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,537
with your own hand.

82
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,624
You're a rare talent.

83
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:55,878
When you're fighting
cripples, anyway.

84
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,431
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

85
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:02,518
I'll bet that thrust through the Mad
King's back was pretty as a picture.

86
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:04,887
<i>You want to fight pretty</i>
<i>or you want to win?</i>

87
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:06,722
You talk to my brother this way?

88
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:08,307
All the time.

89
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,692
He got used to it.

90
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,569
Do you think he did it?

91
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,704
No.

92
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:25,240
Oh, he hated
the little twat, sure.

93
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:27,242
But who didn't?

94
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:30,295
And poison's not his style.

95
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:33,749
Or murder, for that matter.

96
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:37,469
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

97
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,976
You haven't been
to see him yet, eh?

98
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:46,929
We're done for today.

99
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

100
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:55,320
You stood for him in his trial
by combat at the Eyrie.

101
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:57,489
Aye.

102
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,524
But only when
Lady Arryn demanded

103
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:02,194
the trial take place that day.

104
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,363
You were his first choice.

105
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:06,782
He named you for his champion

106
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,452
because he knew you would ride day
and night to come fight for him.

107
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:13,922
You gonna fight for him now?

108
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:24,633
To tell you the truth,
this isn't so bad.

109
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:27,719
Four walls.
A pot to piss in.

110
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:30,522
I was chained to a wooden post

111
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:33,141
covered in my own
shit for months.

112
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:38,730
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

113
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,482
Maybe a bit.

114
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,237
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

115
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:48,123
It's complicated, yes.

116
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:52,127
- So how is our sister?
- How do you think?

117
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:54,746
Her son died in her arms.

118
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:57,332
Her son?

119
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:59,751
Don't.

120
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,541
You know what's coming?

121
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,378
My trial for regicide.
Yes, I know.

122
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:14,449
I know the whole bloody
country thinks I'm guilty.

123
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:16,652
I know that one
of my three judges

124
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,904
has wished me dead more
times than I can count.

125
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:21,440
And that judge is my father.

126
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,026
As for Cersei,

127
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:26,028
well, she's probably
working on a way

128
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:28,914
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

129
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:32,384
Now that you mention it,
she did ask.

130
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:35,287
So, should I turn around
and close my eyes?

131
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:37,472
Depends.

132
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:39,691
Did you do it?

133
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,476
The Kingslayer brothers.

134
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:44,880
You like it?
I like it.

135
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:49,384
You're really asking
if I killed your son?

136
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:52,938
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

137
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,377
How can I help you?

138
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,946
Well, you could set me free.

139
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,116
You know I can't.

140
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,202
Then there's really
nothing else to say.

141
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:09,571
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?

142
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,073
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

143
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:13,075
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

144
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:14,876
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

145
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,995
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

146
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:18,497
Inappropriate?

147
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:21,500
You're accused of killing the king.
Freeing you is treason.

148
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:23,418
Except I didn't do it.

149
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,470
Which is why
we're having a trial.

150
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:27,806
A trial.

151
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,592
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

152
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:34,930
confessed to his crimes, and gave
irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

153
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,398
<i>it wouldn't matter to Cersei.</i>

154
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:39,434
She won't rest
until my head's on a spike.

155
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,603
Not just yours.

156
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:44,990
She's offering a knighthood
to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

157
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,608
Sansa couldn't have done this.

158
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,444
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

159
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,947
Do you think it's a coincidence she
disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

160
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:54,282
No, but...

161
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,502
Sansa's not a killer.

162
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:01,173
Not yet, anyway.

163
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,688
Where are you taking me?

164
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,890
I'm getting married
to your Aunt Lysa.

165
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:21,143
She's waiting for us
at the Eyrie.

166
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,979
You'll be safe there.

167
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,793
Did you kill Joffrey?

168
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,996
Did I kill Joffrey?

169
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,299
I've been in the Vale for weeks.

170
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,500
I know it was you.

171
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:49,471
And who helped me
with this conspiracy?

172
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:53,341
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

173
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,594
You used him to get
me out of King's Landing,

174
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:58,230
but you would never trust
him to kill the king.

175
00:15:58,347 --> 00:16:01,900
- Why not? - Because you're too smart
to trust a drunk.

176
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:04,486
Then perhaps it was
your husband.

177
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,021
No.

178
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:07,823
<i>How do you know?</i>

179
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,492
I just do.

180
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,661
You're right.

181
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,163
He wasn't involved
in Joffrey's death.

182
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,199
But you were.

183
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:21,953
<i>Do you remember that lovely</i>
<i>necklace Dontos gave you?</i>

184
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:26,174
<i>I don't suppose you noticed</i>
<i>that a stone was missing</i>

185
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,460
<i>after the feast.</i>

186
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:31,046
The poison.

187
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:35,050
I don't understand.

188
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,686
The Lannisters gave you
wealth, power.

189
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,521
Joffrey made you
the Lord of Harrenhal.

190
00:16:39,555 --> 00:16:42,390
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

191
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:45,110
<i>Always keep your foes confused.</i>

192
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:48,063
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

193
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:51,199
they can't know
what you plan to do next.

194
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:56,121
I don't believe you.

195
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:00,292
<i>If they catch you, they'll
put your head on a spike</i>

196
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:01,710
<i>just like my father's.</i>

197
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:04,913
You'd risk that
just to confuse them?

198
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,085
So many men,
they risk so little.

199
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,088
They spend their lives
avoiding danger.

200
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:15,557
And then they die.

201
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:20,645
I'd risk everything
to get what I want.

202
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,815
And what do you want?

203
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,356
Everything.

204
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:36,528
My friendship with the
Lannisters was productive.

205
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,281
But Joffrey,

206
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,833
a vicious boy with
a crown on his head,

207
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,119
is not a reliable ally.

208
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,121
And who could trust
a friend like that?

209
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,423
Who could trust you?

210
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,960
I don't want friends like me.

211
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,462
My new friends are predictable.

212
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,014
Very reasonable people.

213
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:58,767
<i>As for what happened to Joffrey,</i>

214
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:03,104
well, that was something my new
friends wanted very badly.

215
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:05,607
<i>Nothing like a thoughtful gift</i>

216
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,226
<i>to make a new friendship</i>
<i>grow strong.</i>

217
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,145
I can't believe you're going.

218
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,814
Leaving me alone here
with these people.

219
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:15,150
<i>The time has come, my dear.</i>

220
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:18,236
There's nothing
more tedious than a trial.

221
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,739
Except perhaps these gardens.

222
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,491
If I have to take one
more leisurely stroll

223
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:26,745
through these gardens, I'll
fling myself from the cliffs.

224
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,298
Have you been to see Tommen yet?

225
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,300
No.

226
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:34,252
Have they even agreed
to the match?

227
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,004
No one tells me anything.

228
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:40,258
I wasn't originally meant to marry
your grandfather Luthor, you know.

229
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,677
He was engaged to my sister,

230
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,846
your great-aunt Viola.

231
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:48,149
I was to be given to
some Targaryen or other.

232
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:51,903
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

233
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:54,489
But the moment
I saw my intended,

234
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:57,859
with his twitchy
little ferret's face

235
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,861
and ludicrous silver hair,

236
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,913
I knew he wouldn't do.

237
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:04,499
So the evening

238
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,585
before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,

239
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,288
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

240
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,624
and happened upon his chamber.

241
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:16,211
- How absentminded of me.
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:20,432
The following morning, Luthor
never made it down the stairs

243
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:24,219
to propose to my sister 'cause
the boy couldn't bloody walk.

244
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,554
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

245
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,973
was what I'd given him
the night before.

246
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,192
I was good.

247
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,895
I was very, very good.

248
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,366
You are even better.

249
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,984
But you need to act quickly.

250
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:43,872
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

251
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,791
She'll turn the boy against
you as soon as she can.

252
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:50,128
And by the time you're
married, it'll be too late.

253
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:52,130
Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent

254
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,998
is rather distracted
at the moment,

255
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,468
mourning her dear departed boy.

256
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:58,887
Accusing her brother
of his murder,

257
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,889
which he didn't commit.

258
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,057
Well, he could have done.

259
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,008
He could have done,
but he didn't.

260
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,062
- You don't know, Grandmother.
- But I do know.

261
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:11,683
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

262
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,770
What?
I don't understand.

263
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:19,441
Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.

264
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:24,112
You just do
what needs to be done.

265
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:27,582
<i>Bring it through!</i>

266
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:37,208
And again.

267
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,468
Very nice. Good.

268
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,137
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

269
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:52,190
First thing you want to do

270
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:54,976
is disarm them to try
and even the odds.

271
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,458
Let's see what you can do.

272
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,162
Olly, you just watch for now.

273
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,246
I can fight.

274
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,332
Have you ever
held a sword before?

275
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:19,417
I was the best archer
in our hamlet.

276
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:21,836
I was!

277
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:24,172
I believe you.

278
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:25,890
We'll go hunting
for rabbits one day.

279
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:27,642
Right now, watch and learn.

280
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,896
You two.

281
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:35,016
Take it slow,
try and disarm each other.

282
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,594
You know how to fight.

283
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,096
You could have gone
easier on him.

284
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,549
He wouldn't have learned
anything that way.

285
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:10,552
<i>Lord Snow.</i>

286
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:13,054
What do you think you're doing?

287
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:15,723
Grenn and I were helping them.

288
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:17,892
Grenn's a ranger.
You're a steward.

289
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:21,029
Maybe you forgot that while you
were off with your wildling bitch,

290
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,031
but I didn't.

291
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:25,400
Someone has to train them.

292
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:27,285
And that someone isn't you.

293
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,654
Go find a chamber pot to empty.

294
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,959
Go on. Do it.

295
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,995
You traitor's bastard.

296
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:38,963
Give me an excuse.

297
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,916
Mormont's not here
to protect you now.

298
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:55,313
Get back to work.

299
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:57,765
Now!

300
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,318
I said now!

301
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:06,574
The bastard's well-liked.
You're not.

302
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,160
You think I care if they like me?
We're at war.

303
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:10,745
For now.

304
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,947
But you can't be
acting commander forever.

305
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:15,116
There will be a choosing.

306
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:17,118
The old maester
will insist on it.

307
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,621
You might reconsider

308
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:22,373
his request to march
on Craster's.

309
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:26,010
Let the mutineers
take care of Snow.

310
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:28,463
Or you might be taking
orders from him

311
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,048
the rest of your life.

312
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:47,065
A bastard, eh?

313
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:49,817
Took you for highborn.

314
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,204
My father was highborn.

315
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:55,907
My mother wasn't.

316
00:23:58,077 --> 00:23:59,994
Name's Locke.

317
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:03,831
Jon Snow.

318
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:08,720
You fight well.

319
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:10,471
What brought you up here?

320
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,590
A sense of duty.

321
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:15,893
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

322
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:21,182
I was a game warden
in the Stormlands.

323
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:23,818
Fed a prized partridge
to my hungry kids.

324
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,653
I was stupid enough
to get caught.

325
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:27,822
Chose the Wall
over losing my hand.

326
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:31,526
Figured I wouldn't have to suck
up to any highborn cunts here.

327
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:33,828
<i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

328
00:24:33,862 --> 00:24:35,580
What are you
waiting for? Summer?

329
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:37,081
Guess I was wrong.

330
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,387
You sent for me, Your Grace?

331
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,356
Your Grace.

332
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,191
How formal of you.

333
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,312
How many Kingsguards are
posted outside Tommen's door?

334
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:11,733
Ser Boros is on duty tonight.

335
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:14,152
- Tomorrow I believe...
- <i> So one?</i>

336
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:18,322
You have one man
guarding the future king?

337
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:20,408
I promise you Tommen's safe.

338
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:21,709
We're protecting him.

339
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:24,879
The way you protected Joffrey?

340
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:28,750
Why did Catelyn Stark
set you free?

341
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,419
- What?
- I've been wondering for months.

342
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,256
Ever since that great cow brought
you back to the capital.

343
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:37,925
Why did she set you free?

344
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,928
You know why. She'd hoped I'd
send her daughters back to her.

345
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,935
She hoped or did you promise?

346
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,771
I swore by all the gods

347
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:52,273
that if her daughters were
alive, I'd return them to her.

348
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:54,242
So you made a sacred vow
to the enemy.

349
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:56,944
I wanted to get back to you.

350
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,781
Should I have told her
to fuck off?

351
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,699
You didn't mean it, then?

352
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,752
You have no loyalty
to Catelyn Stark?

353
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:06,621
Catelyn Stark's dead.

354
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:08,956
So if I told you to leave the
capital right now and find Sansa,

355
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:13,127
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

356
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:15,179
and bring me her head,

357
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,448
would you do it?

358
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,238
I know you went to see Tyrion.

359
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:30,411
That creature
who murdered our son.

360
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:34,882
I had to see him.

361
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,400
I had to know for myself.

362
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:38,453
And?

363
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:42,657
He didn't do it, Cersei.

364
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,159
You've always pitied him.

365
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:48,496
Our poor little brother.

366
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:50,331
Abused by the world.

367
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,333
Despised by his father
and sister.

368
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:55,219
He'd kill us all if he could.

369
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:01,392
I want four men at Tommen's
door day and night.

370
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:05,646
That will be all,
Lord Commander.

371
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:42,300
Ser Pounce?

372
00:27:56,231 --> 00:27:58,449
How did you get past
the Kingsguard?

373
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:01,118
Kingsguard.

374
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,706
I don't think you're
supposed to be here.

375
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,743
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

376
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:11,295
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.

377
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,565
Word has it
I'm to be your bride.

378
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:22,056
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

379
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,092
often never meet
until their wedding day?

380
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:31,482
Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

381
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:33,734
we ought to get
to know one another.

382
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,937
Don't you think?

383
00:28:37,422 --> 00:28:39,273
Yes.

384
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:41,359
But if my mother
found out...

385
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,045
It can be our secret.
Hmm?

386
00:28:45,998 --> 00:28:48,449
If we're going to be
man and wife,

387
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:52,386
we'll have a few secrets
from her, I hope.

388
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:56,374
So, Your Grace...

389
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,759
Yes?

390
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:01,596
Tell me a secret.

391
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:11,339
Hello. Aren't you
a proper fellow?

392
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:13,724
That's Ser Pounce.

393
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:16,127
Very handsome.

394
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:19,647
Joffrey didn't like him.

395
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:22,149
He threatened to skin him alive

396
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,985
and mix his innards
up in my food

397
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:25,820
so I wouldn't know
I was eating him.

398
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:28,572
That's very cruel.

399
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:31,559
You don't strike me as cruel.

400
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:34,729
No.

401
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:36,631
I don't think I am.

402
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:38,699
That's a relief.

403
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:41,068
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

404
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:43,337
We say our vows in front
of the high septon.

405
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:45,172
And after the ceremony,
there's a feast.

406
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,642
When we marry, I become yours.

407
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,226
Forever.

408
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:53,731
It's getting late.

409
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,184
I should go.

410
00:29:58,186 --> 00:29:59,820
May I come and visit you again?

411
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,792
All right, then.

412
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,332
Remember,

413
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:15,002
our little secret.

414
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:53,574
<i>"Ser Jaime Lannister.</i>

415
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:57,378
<i>Knighted and named to the
Kingsguard in his 16th year.</i>

416
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,914
At the sack of King's Landing,

417
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,333
murdered his king Aerys II.

418
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:05,586
Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.

419
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,839
Thereafter known
as the Kingslayer."

420
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,176
It's the duty of the Lord
Commander to fill those pages.

421
00:31:15,347 --> 00:31:18,149
And there's still room
left on mine.

422
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:50,798
Valyrian steel.

423
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,300
Mmm.

424
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,635
It's yours.

425
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:56,303
I can't accept this.

426
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:58,639
It was reforged
from Ned Stark's sword.

427
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,809
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

428
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:07,364
You swore an oath to return the
Stark girls to their mother.

429
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,784
Lady Stark's dead.

430
00:32:09,818 --> 00:32:11,735
Arya's probably dead, too,

431
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:14,955
but there's still a chance to find
Sansa and get her somewhere safe.

432
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,908
I've got something else for you.

433
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:39,063
<i>I hope I got</i>
<i>your measurements right.</i>

434
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,350
I'll find her.

435
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,189
For Lady Catelyn.

436
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:52,860
And for you.

437
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,919
I almost forgot.

438
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,039
I have one more gift.

439
00:33:08,877 --> 00:33:10,761
I don't need a squire.

440
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,713
Of course you do.

441
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:14,348
He'll slow me down.

442
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:16,717
My brother owes him a debt.
He's not safe here.

443
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,270
You're keeping him from harm.
It's chivalry.

444
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:22,356
I won't
slow you down, ser...

445
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,809
my lady.

446
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:28,312
<i>I promise I'll serve you well.</i>

447
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:31,649
See? He's a good lad.
You'll get along.

448
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,155
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

449
00:33:38,206 --> 00:33:41,208
His axe from the Blackwater.

450
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:48,382
What are you
waiting for, a kiss?

451
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:52,303
Ready the lady's horse.

452
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:04,064
They say the best swords
have names.

453
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:05,516
Any ideas?

454
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:13,357
Oathkeeper.

455
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:26,754
Good-bye, Brienne.

456
00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:52,646
Come on, move.

457
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:19,390
I should never
have taken her away.

458
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,559
- She wasn't safe here.
- She's not safe out there.

459
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,428
I should have known.

460
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,647
You told us there were
wildlings south of the Wall.

461
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:29,433
<i>If they're raiding the smaller
villages, Mole's Town could be next.</i>

462
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:32,853
- Castle Black could be next.
- I should go back for Gilly.

463
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:34,488
We have orders. No one's
to leave the castle.

464
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:37,024
I remember when you disobeyed
orders and rode south to help Robb.

465
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,243
And I remember who came after
me and brought me home.

466
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:44,732
I know how hard
it is, Sam, believe me.

467
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:49,586
When you told me about Bran
going beyond the Wall,

468
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:53,007
all I could think about was getting my
strength back so I could go and find him.

469
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:56,877
I wish I could have convinced
him to come back with me.

470
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:01,181
I tried.
Really, I did.

471
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:05,719
How fast could they travel?

472
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,223
A crippled boy being pulled
on a sledge by a simpleton?

473
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:10,808
I don't know.

474
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,060
They'd pass wildling villages.

475
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:16,146
They could try to find
shelter at one of them.

476
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:20,401
The wildlings
have joined up with Mance.

477
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:23,737
Every village or sheltered
place will be deserted.

478
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:29,209
Except...

479
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:34,782
<i>Craster's?</i>

480
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:37,251
You think Bran
might have found...

481
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:39,720
Snow.

482
00:36:39,754 --> 00:36:41,388
I don't mean to interrupt.

483
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:44,091
Thorne wants to see you.

484
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:50,230
Your foray to Craster's Keep,

485
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:52,316
I'll sanction it.

486
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,236
But I won't order
anyone to go with you.

487
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:58,939
Volunteers only.

488
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:01,108
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

489
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:13,620
Ahem, brothers.

490
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,634
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep.

491
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:32,022
I'm going to capture the mutineers
holed up there or kill them.

492
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:35,142
<i>I'm asking for volunteers</i>
<i>to come with me.</i>

493
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:39,480
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's

494
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:42,316
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

495
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,451
but we have to do this.

496
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:47,738
<i>Our survival may depend on</i>

497
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:50,624
<i>us getting to these mutineers
before Mance does.</i>

498
00:37:50,658 --> 00:37:54,328
They know the Wall.
They know our defenses.

499
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,331
If Mance learns what
they know, we're lost.

500
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:02,136
But if that's not enough,

501
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,638
then consider this.

502
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:07,007
If the Night's Watch
are truly brothers,

503
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:10,010
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

504
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:13,347
He lived and died for the Watch

505
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:15,849
and he was betrayed
by his own men.

506
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,601
Stabbed in the back by cowards.

507
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:19,570
He deserved far better.

508
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:23,157
All we can give him now
is justice.

509
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:26,443
Who will join me?

510
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:18,745
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

511
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:21,048
Then let me say my vows.

512
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:24,301
If it's a fight you're heading for,
then you need men who know how.

513
00:39:36,764 --> 00:39:38,649
Thank you, brothers.

514
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:48,442
<i>No, don't.</i>

515
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:51,245
<i>Don't, please.</i>

516
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,363
<i>Please don't. Ow!</i>

517
00:39:53,414 --> 00:39:55,332
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

518
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,958
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley

519
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,128
drinking wine from the skull

520
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,632
of Jeor fucking Mormont.

521
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:21,975
Any command for us,
Lord Commander?

522
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:24,561
What's that?

523
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:27,030
Fuck 'em till they're dead?

524
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:30,617
<i> Did you hear that, boys?</i>

525
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:33,287
Fuck 'em till they're dead.

526
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:41,211
Rast.

527
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:48,969
Go outside and feed the beast.

528
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:51,338
We should kill that thing.

529
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:55,342
You should shut
your fucking hole,

530
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:58,345
ugly little cunt.

531
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:01,815
You look like
a fucking ballsack.

532
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:04,601
Ugly. Look at your
stupid cunt face.

533
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:08,188
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

534
00:41:09,991 --> 00:41:13,610
Know how much they paid me to
kill a man in King's Landing?

535
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:16,246
Seven silvers.

536
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,033
They told me a man's name and that
man never saw daylight again.

537
00:41:20,035 --> 00:41:22,836
None of them cocksuckers
got away from me.

538
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,426
Haven't lost a fight
since I was nine.

539
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:33,296
Maybe it's time.

540
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:36,049
What do you think, eh?

541
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,186
Maybe you're the man.

542
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,356
Eh, cunt?

543
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:47,060
I wouldn't stand a chance.

544
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:49,146
None of us would.

545
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:52,232
I was a fucking legend
in Gin Alley.

546
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:55,369
A fucking legend!

547
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:56,987
I would take any knight...

548
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:59,740
any knight, any time.

549
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:03,460
Fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

550
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:15,472
- A gift for the gods.
- A gift for the gods.

551
00:42:15,506 --> 00:42:17,090
A gift for the gods.

552
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:18,642
What the fuck is that?

553
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:21,845
Craster's last child.
A boy.

554
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:23,430
What am I supposed
to do with him?

555
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:26,266
What did Craster do with 'em?

556
00:42:26,317 --> 00:42:29,519
Kill 'em before they could grow
up and do the same to him?

557
00:42:30,905 --> 00:42:32,606
All right.

558
00:42:36,027 --> 00:42:37,661
Don't need another
mouth to feed.

559
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,914
- Hand him over.
- He didn't kill them.

560
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:43,617
- He offered them.
- To who?

561
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:45,836
To the gods.

562
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,121
The white walkers.

563
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:50,207
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

564
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:53,093
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

565
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:55,629
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

566
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:57,347
Shut up!

567
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:05,472
So...

568
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:10,477
if it worked for him...

569
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:14,865
Let's give the walkers
what they want.

570
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,458
Rast is headed that way.

571
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:53,663
Pink-eyed fuck.

572
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,219
You thirsty?

573
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:20,941
Fuck!

574
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:56,559
Hodor.

575
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:03,900
Do you hear that?

576
00:46:10,324 --> 00:46:12,125
Is that a baby?

577
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:14,711
It's coming.

578
00:46:14,745 --> 00:46:16,496
I'm going out there.

579
00:46:16,498 --> 00:46:18,632
No, we need to stay together.

580
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm going.

581
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,544
- Bran. Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

582
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:06,212
- Hodor.
- Bran, what happened?

583
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:08,932
Summer, he's hurt. They've
caught him in a trap.

584
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:10,350
Who?

585
00:47:10,384 --> 00:47:13,053
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

586
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:16,890
They have Ghost.

587
00:47:22,229 --> 00:47:23,863
<i>They're Night's Watch.</i>

588
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,982
Look.

589
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,451
<i>Jon might be here.</i>

590
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:31,821
If Jon was here, why would
they put his wolf in a cage?

591
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:40,413
They might have been Night's
Watch once, not anymore.

592
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:42,248
We're not safe here.
We need to go.

593
00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:43,800
No.

594
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:46,169
Bran, we need to go now.

595
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,088
I'm not leaving without Summer.

596
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,596
Can you remember
where the cage was?

597
00:47:56,598 --> 00:47:59,182
The east side of the keep.

598
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:04,604
If I'm not back
soon, we'll meet...

599
00:48:04,655 --> 00:48:06,489
Hodor.

600
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:21,838
Hodor.

601
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,543
Hodor.
Hodor.

602
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:32,632
Hodor.

603
00:48:32,634 --> 00:48:35,885
If I was your size, I'd be
king of the fucking world.

604
00:48:47,565 --> 00:48:49,566
Help him up.

605
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:14,007
This is nice.

606
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:17,844
Fine leather.

607
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,314
You're no wildling.

608
00:49:21,348 --> 00:49:23,850
Important. Highborn.

609
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,188
Who are you?

610
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:39,199
You see, where I come from,

611
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,784
a commoner like me slaps
a little lord like you,

612
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:44,037
I'd lose my right hand.

613
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:48,124
But we're a long way
from home, aren't we?

614
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:51,594
And the two of you,

615
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:55,215
fancy-looking folks
north of the Wall

616
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:57,467
creeping through the woods.

617
00:49:58,802 --> 00:50:01,104
Isn't that a bit odd?

618
00:50:04,525 --> 00:50:06,776
I like your curly hair.

619
00:50:08,562 --> 00:50:11,781
My mom had curls like that.

620
00:50:11,815 --> 00:50:14,784
Beautiful brown curls.

621
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:19,372
Why'd you drag a crippled
boy all the way up here?

622
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:28,331
See you haven't played
this game before.

623
00:50:28,382 --> 00:50:30,667
A highborn hostage,

624
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:33,586
<i>that's valuable.</i>

625
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:36,055
But three of them,

626
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,092
that's a lot of mouths to feed.

627
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:42,428
<i>- What the fuck's wrong with him?</i>
- Come here.

628
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,430
No, please.

629
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:45,932
Please.
Please, let me help him.

630
00:50:45,934 --> 00:50:47,850
- Who are you?
- Please.

631
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:51,237
- Who are you?
- I'm Brandon Stark!

632
00:50:51,272 --> 00:50:53,856
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

633
00:50:56,277 --> 00:50:58,828
It's Jon Snow's brother.

634
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:02,749
It's Meera. It's Meera.
I'm right here.

635
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:07,453
And I thought this was gonna
be another boring day.

636
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:14,427
<i>I'm right here.</i>

637
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:51,829
