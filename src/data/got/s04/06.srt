1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:02,856
You're accused of killing the king.

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:04,217
I didn't do it.

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,789
Which is why we're having a trial.

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:08,011
One of my three judges is my father.

5
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:12,189
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
I want you to be the third.

6
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:15,077
I will also invite you to sit
on the Small Council.

7
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:18,485
I never realized you had
such respect for Dorne.

8
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:21,438
What good is power if you cannot
protect the ones you love?

9
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:22,702
You can avenge them.

10
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:25,082
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

11
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:27,720
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,851
It would be a great honor.

13
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:31,260
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,786
I will speak to mine.

15
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:35,670
You started wars
to protect this family's future.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,163
Tyrion deserves
for lighting our future to fire.

17
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:40,958
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

18
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,483
The kind who serves his king.

19
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:44,939
The next time Ser Meryn speaks,
kill him.

20
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:48,087
How many Hands have you betrayed,
Pycelle?

21
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,298
- I am loyal servant!
- Throw him in one of the black cells.

22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,626
Oh no, no, no, no.

23
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,909
There are many who know that without you,
this city faced certain defeat.

24
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:01,077
The king won't give you any honors,
but we will not forget.

25
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:04,364
The city is yours.
All these people are your subjects now.

26
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:07,668
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice with mercy.

27
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:11,244
I will answer injustice with justice.

28
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,880
"Find a special gift.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,382
"Theon's favorite toy.

30
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,135
"He cried when I took it away from him."

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,232
I'm going to pick
the fastest ship in our fleet.

32
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:26,422
and I'm going to bring him home.

33
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:28,769
We need to look East for ships and men.

34
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:30,993
- Soldiers win wars.
- We don't have any gold.

35
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:34,799
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos,
which means you're running out of time.

36
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:32,166

37
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,920
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that...

38
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,223
We've been here since midday.

39
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,352
Easterners have a difference
sense of time, I've often found.

40
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,356
Once I was waiting for Salladhor
Saan here in Braavos.

41
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,025
Together, we were going to run

42
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,577
three shiploads
of the finest...

43
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,990
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

44
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,277
Please, sit.

45
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,385
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

46
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,387
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

47
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,656
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

48
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,626
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

49
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,815
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

50
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,734
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

51
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,269
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

52
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,188
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

53
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,908
He shares no blood with me.

54
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,328
He is a bastard born of incest.

55
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,413
<i>As was his brother before him.</i>

56
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,199
Yes, we have heard this story.

57
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,869
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

58
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,255
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

59
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,674
A story about a jealous uncle

60
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,910
whose attempts to usurp the
throne from the rightful king

61
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:40,882
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

62
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,633
Gold you loaned him.

63
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,871
And you feel your blood gives
you a claim on our gold?

64
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,524
More than any man living.

65
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:52,477
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

66
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,646
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

67
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,182
and "blood right."

68
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,352
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

69
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,571
We prefer the stories they tell.

70
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,523
More plain.

71
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:08,993
Less open to interpretation.

72
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:14,115
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

73
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:15,500
4,000.

74
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,502
<i>And how many ships do you have?</i>

75
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,804
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

76
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:22,306
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

77
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,676
32.

78
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,478
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

79
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,847
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

80
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,635
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

81
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,656
None.

82
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,526
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

83
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,695
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

84
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,466
<i>I'm afraid we must respectfully</i>

85
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,552
<i>decline your request.</i>

86
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:54,705
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

87
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,882
My lord.

88
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,635
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

89
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,804
You would not be either here.

90
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,756
In Braavos,

91
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,026
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

92
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,561
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

93
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,196
That would be the pirates.

94
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,616
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

95
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:25,152
This is the payment
that was demanded

96
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,487
by King Stannis for my crimes.

97
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,906
I consider it
an honest accounting.

98
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,409
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

99
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,911
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

100
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,714
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

101
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,082
The war is over.

102
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,585
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

103
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,587
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

104
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,755
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

105
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,392
- <i> Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

106
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,829
- 67.
- 67. And when he dies, who's in command?

107
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:53,931
A half-grown boy,

108
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,267
<i>the product of incest?</i>

109
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,103
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

110
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,806
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

111
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,941
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

112
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,612
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

113
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,281
That is a problem
for another time.

114
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,583
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

115
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:16,754
There's only one reliable
leader left in Westeros.

116
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,589
Stannis.

117
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,458
He's got the birthright.

118
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:22,627
He's in his prime.

119
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,378
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

120
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,631
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

121
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:28,015
he does it.

122
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:35,139
<i> The lookout sees a
pirate ship sailing their way.</i>

123
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,141
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

124
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,026
"Bring me
my red shirt."

125
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,029
The first mate brings the red
shirt and the captain puts it on.

126
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:43,981
And when the pirates
try to board,

127
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,367
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

128
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:49,787
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

129
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,622
"Two pirate ships!"

130
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,459
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

131
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,461
But the courageous
captain hollers,

132
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,297
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

133
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,549
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

134
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:05,419
"Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

135
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,004
The captain replies,

136
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:10,841
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

137
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:13,094
The next morning
the lookout screams,

138
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,596
"10 pirate ships!

139
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,432
We are surrounded!"

140
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,234
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

141
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,770
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

142
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,905
<i>waiting for his usual command.</i>

143
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,941
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

144
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:29,360
"Bring me my brown pants!"

145
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:35,666
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

146
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:39,120
Davos.

147
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,539
I heard you were rotting in
a dungeon in Dragonstone.

148
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,874
Only half rotted.

149
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,596
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

150
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,549
This is Lhara.

151
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,150
- And this is...
- I am Lhara.

152
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,856
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

153
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,226
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

154
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,694
We?

155
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,896
You, me... we.

156
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:11,235
Once I thought
this man loved me.

157
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,406
<i>Now I know he despises me.</i>

158
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,794
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold...

159
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,422
You won't be alone.

160
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,973
And you won't be poor.

161
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,350
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

162
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,269
I gave it to your wife.

163
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,941
You're not my friend, my friend.

164
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,578
I'll see you at sunrise.

165
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,834
"I give you
until the full moon

166
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:03,454
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

167
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:07,174
<i>and back to those shit-stained
rocks you call home.</i>

168
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,210
On the first night
of the full moon,

169
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,012
I will hunt down every
islander still on our lands

170
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,964
and flay them living,

171
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,634
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

172
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,269
I found at Winterfell.

173
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,139
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift...</i>

174
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:25,643
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

175
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:28,479
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

176
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,650
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

177
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,819
<i>with more Theon.</i>

178
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,871
<i>Signed Ramsay Snow,</i>

179
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:40,324
<i>natural born son</i>
<i>of Roose Bolton,</i>

180
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,326
<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

181
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,296
<i>and Warden of the North."</i>

182
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,298
Yes!

183
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,467
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

184
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:52,253
<i>and they mutilated my brother,</i>

185
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,638
<i>your prince.</i>

186
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,724
<i>Your prince.</i>

187
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,510
<i>Everything they've done to him,</i>

188
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,595
<i>they've also done to you.</i>

189
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,063
Yes! Yes!

190
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:07,017
<i>As long as they can hurt
our prince with impunity,</i>

191
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,021
<i>the word ironborn means nothing.</i>

192
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,881
Go left.

193
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,058
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know...

194
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,443
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.

195
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:50,811
Take me to the dungeons.

196
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:53,063
He's not in the dungeons.

197
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,590
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,094
<i> This way!</i>

199
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,493
We're going home.

200
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,247
No!

201
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,420
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

202
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,589
You can't trick me.

203
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:53,791
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

204
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,626
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

205
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,011
Not Theon! Reek!

206
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,796
- Reek! My name is Reek!
<i>-  They're here.</i>

207
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,297
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

208
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,966
Help me with him.

209
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,884
No, you can't!

210
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,686
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

211
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,857
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

212
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:13,143
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

213
00:15:13,194 --> 00:15:15,980
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

214
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:29,326
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

215
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,227
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

216
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:49,179
Loyal Reek!

217
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,605
Aah!
Theon!

218
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:18,090
Give me my broth You've got
bigger balls than he ever did.

219
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:23,845
But with those big balls
of yours...

220
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,019
how fast can you run?

221
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,499
Make for the ship, now.

222
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,201
But your brother.

223
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,203
My brother is dead.

224
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:58,680
I have a treat for you.

225
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:00,382
A reward.

226
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,968
Reward?

227
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,270
Yes, Reek.

228
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:08,223
Those creatures
who came in the night,

229
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,892
they wanted to take you away.

230
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,861
And you didn't let them.

231
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,297
You remained loyal.

232
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:19,234
I... I didn't want
them to take me.

233
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,987
I was so scared.

234
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:24,323
- I didn't want them...
- Yes, yes, Reek.

235
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,550
It's a bath.

236
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:37,919
For you.

237
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,642
Remove those rags.

238
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,678
Now.

239
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,280
The britches, too, Reek.

240
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:06,948
Take them off.

241
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,871
Do you love me, Reek?

242
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:44,379
Yes, of course, my lord.

243
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:47,632
Good.

244
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:50,018
Because I need you
to do something for me.

245
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,104
Something very important.

246
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:55,390
There's a castle, you see.

247
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,527
Some bad men hold this castle.

248
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:02,731
I need your help
to take this castle back.

249
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,036
But how can...

250
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,574
I need you to play a role.

251
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,661
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

252
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:22,417
Pretend to be who?

253
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,253
Theon Greyjoy.

254
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:38,109
_

255
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,005
_

256
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,003
_

257
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:42,774
_

258
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:45,244
_

259
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,649
_

260
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:51,376
_

261
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:54,424
_

262
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,796
_

263
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,144
He is a goatherd.

264
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:16,715
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

265
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,351
I thank him for his prayers.

266
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,851
It was your dragons, he says.

267
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:40,438
<i>They came this morning</i>
<i>for his flock.</i>

268
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,561
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

269
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,229
but now he has nothing.

270
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:51,449
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

271
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:55,303
<i> I cannot bring back his goats,</i>

272
00:22:55,338 --> 00:23:00,158
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

273
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,760
Send the next one in.

274
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:31,877
_

275
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:39,377
_

276
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,429
Queen Daenerys.

277
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:56,514
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

278
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:58,600
I thank you.

279
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:01,636
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

280
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:04,305
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

281
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,275
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

282
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,278
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

283
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:12,614
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

284
00:24:12,648 --> 00:24:14,165
This pyramid included.

285
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,368
For that, he has my gratitude.

286
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:18,069
I should be honored to meet him.

287
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:19,554
You have, Your Grace.

288
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,389
You crucified him.

289
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:25,660
I pray you'll never live to see

290
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:27,662
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

291
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:31,232
Your father crucified
innocent children.

292
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,719
My father spoke out against
crucifying those children.

293
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:37,956
He decried it as a criminal
act, but was overruled.

294
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,326
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

295
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,812
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

296
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:47,182
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

297
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:50,001
You'd be wise to remember that.

298
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,987
What's done is done.

299
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:56,157
You are the queen and I
am a servant of Meereen.

300
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:59,861
A servant who does not wish to
see its traditions eradicated.

301
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:02,697
And what traditions
do you speak of?

302
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:04,699
<i>The tradition of funeral rite.</i>

303
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,035
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

304
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:11,623
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

305
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:14,008
are still nailed to those posts,

306
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:17,212
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

307
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:29,274
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

308
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:31,526
so that they might receive
proper burials.

309
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,730
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

310
00:25:35,732 --> 00:25:38,233
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

311
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:41,903
<i>Would you have begged me for
their right to a proper burial?</i>

312
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:44,656
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

313
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,626
I can only speak to you as a
son who loved his father.

314
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,912
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

315
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:53,798
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

316
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,333
and buried with dignity

317
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:57,752
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

318
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,642
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

319
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,649
Thank you, my queen.

320
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:24,629
How many more?

321
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,949
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

322
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,785
212?

323
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,762
Send the next one in.

324
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,383
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

325
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:48,520
I was up late last night.

326
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:52,557
So, does this mean I am a
master of something now?

327
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,475
Coins, ships?

328
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:56,728
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

329
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,981
that I shall be the Master
of Ships long before you...

330
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,988
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

331
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,490
to have been granted a
seat on this council. I...

332
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,492
<i>The trial
begins this afternoon.</i>

333
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:13,711
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

334
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,213
Shall we begin?

335
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:17,248
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

336
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,084
in the Riverlands, my lord.

337
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:21,469
A coward and a traitor.

338
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:25,757
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

339
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:28,509
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

340
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,311
Disgraceful.

341
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:32,180
<i>What would it take
to make the common soldier</i>

342
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,482
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

343
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:37,085
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

344
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,938
Make it 100.
What else?

345
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:42,523
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

346
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,108
The Targaryen girl?

347
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,945
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

348
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:50,598
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

349
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,200
Conquered with what?

350
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:54,168
<i>She commands an army
of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

351
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,204
Some 8,000 strong.

352
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:58,539
She has a company
of sellswords...

353
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,924
the Second Sons.

354
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,377
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her...</i>

355
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:05,680
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

356
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,715
And she has three dragons.

357
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,183
Baby dragons.

358
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:11,352
Larger every year, Your Grace.

359
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:14,856
Mormont is spying on her for us.

360
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,859
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

361
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:20,895
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

362
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,564
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

363
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:25,400
a bit harder than anticipated.

364
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,318
He's an old man.

365
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:29,270
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

366
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,322
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

367
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:34,659
Dismissing him was as
insulting as it was stupid.

368
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,812
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

369
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:41,416
A child with two seasoned
warriors counseling her

370
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,669
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

371
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,754
Lord Varys is right.

372
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:49,257
I have been to Essos and seen
the Unsullied firsthand.

373
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:52,827
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

374
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,595
Less so in the bedroom.

375
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:57,432
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

376
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:59,984
Armies win them all the time.

377
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,270
She must be dealt with.

378
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,322
How, my lord?

379
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:05,690
By force?

380
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:07,759
Eventually, if it comes to that.

381
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:12,864
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

382
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:14,916
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

383
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,869
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

384
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,620
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

385
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:42,694
Prince Oberyn.

386
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:45,146
Lord Varys...

387
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:48,383
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

388
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,952
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

389
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:52,820
And yet everyone does.

390
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:57,792
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

391
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:59,744
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

392
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:02,463
Five years.

393
00:30:02,498 --> 00:30:04,082
May I ask why?

394
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,968
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

395
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,670
Most of us live and die

396
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:11,389
in the same corner
where we were born

397
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:14,342
and never get to see any of it.

398
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:16,978
I don't want to be most of us.

399
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:19,013
Most of us aren't princes.

400
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:23,851
You are from Essos.

401
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,738
Where? Lys?

402
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,774
<i>I have an ear for accents.</i>

403
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:31,492
I've lost my accent entirely.

404
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,027
I have an ear for that as well.

405
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:37,081
<i>How did you get here?</i>

406
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:38,699
It's a long story.

407
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:41,702
One you don't like
telling people.

408
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:44,372
People I trust.

409
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,458
My paramour Ellaria, she would
find you very interesting.

410
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:49,794
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

411
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:52,880
We brought our own wine, not
the swill they serve here.

412
00:30:52,882 --> 00:30:56,050
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

413
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:01,355
You did like boys before?

414
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:05,309
Really?

415
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,228
Girls? Hmm.

416
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,897
I hope you won't be offended when
I say I never would have guessed.

417
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:11,399
Not at all.

418
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:14,235
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

419
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,704
- What then?
- <i> Nothing.</i>

420
00:31:16,738 --> 00:31:19,540
Everybody is interested
in something.

421
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,325
<i>Not me.</i>

422
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:23,578
When I see what
desire does to people,

423
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,546
what it's done to this country,

424
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:28,416
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

425
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:32,887
<i>Besides, the absence of desire</i>

426
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:36,007
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

427
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:37,725
Such as?

428
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:15,930
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

429
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:33,981
Really?

430
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:36,984
Father's orders.

431
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:40,821
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

432
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,167
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

433
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:42,300
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

434
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,051
<i>First of my Name,</i>

435
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:46,387
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

436
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:49,056
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

437
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:52,810
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

438
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:55,980
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

439
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:59,917
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

440
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:03,871
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

441
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:07,191
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

442
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:09,577
And if found guilty...

443
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:13,497
may the gods punish the accused.

444
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:51,502
Tyrion of the House Lannister,

445
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:55,623
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

446
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:59,293
Did you kill King Joffrey?

447
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:01,929
No.

448
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:04,298
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

449
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,767
Not that I know of.

450
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:10,104
How would you say he died, then?

451
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,306
Choked on his pigeon pie.

452
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:15,776
So you would blame the bakers?

453
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:18,195
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

454
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:24,151
The crown may call
its first witness.

455
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:26,320
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

456
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:28,322
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

457
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:30,658
He slapped the king
across the face

458
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:33,160
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

459
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,964
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

460
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:38,883
Right here in this throne room,

461
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:41,802
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

462
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:44,138
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

463
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:46,006
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

464
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,842
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

465
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:50,177
he threatened to have me killed.

466
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:52,229
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

467
00:35:52,264 --> 00:35:55,066
<i>- Silence.</i>
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

468
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,740
while you tore at her
clothes and beat her.

469
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:59,487
Silence!

470
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:03,407
You will not speak
unless called upon.

471
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:06,944
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

472
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:16,036
Basilisk venom,

473
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,589
widow's blood,

474
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,875
wolfsbane,

475
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:23,094
essence of nightshade,

476
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:26,013
sweetsleep,

477
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,132
tears of Lys,

478
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:30,384
demon's dance...

479
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,138
blind eye...

480
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:36,390
I think you have made your
point, Grand Maester.

481
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,225
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

482
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:40,277
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

483
00:36:40,312 --> 00:36:43,230
My stores were plundered.

484
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:44,565
By whom?

485
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:47,451
<i>By the accused,
Tyrion Lannister,</i>

486
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,904
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

487
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:52,406
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

488
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:55,459
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

489
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:59,797
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

490
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,383
Without question.

491
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,255
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

492
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,874
the king's fool.

493
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:13,928
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

494
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:17,731
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

495
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:21,185
She wore this necklace

496
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:23,437
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

497
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:26,740
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

498
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:30,744
and terrible poison
was found inside.

499
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:34,748
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

500
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:37,835
It was.
The Strangler.

501
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:41,705
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

502
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,343
And used to strike down
the most noble child

503
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:49,180
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

504
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:59,390
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

505
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:02,193
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

506
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,645
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

507
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,814
and you will know
the debt is paid."

508
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:10,451
Your own brother
said this to you?

509
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,622
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

510
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:18,876
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

511
00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:23,147
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

512
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,499
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

513
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:29,420
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

514
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:32,506
Tyrion said,

515
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:35,226
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

516
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,528
What debt?

517
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,514
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

518
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:42,349
in the Tower of the Hand.

519
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:44,852
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

520
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:47,521
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

521
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:49,490
He wasn't pleased.

522
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,245
Thank you, Your Grace,

523
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:56,580
for the courage
of your testimony.

524
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:14,632
<i> Do you remember the
precise nature of this threat?</i>

525
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:17,217
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

526
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:21,221
<i>He said, "Perhaps you should
speak more softly to me, then.</i>

527
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:23,140
Monsters are dangerous

528
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:25,609
and just now kings
are dying like flies."

529
00:39:25,644 --> 00:39:28,946
And he said this to you at a
meeting of the small council?

530
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,230
Yes.

531
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:33,367
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

532
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:35,653
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

533
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:38,155
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

534
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:40,624
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

535
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:47,081
You're excused, Lord Varys.

536
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,169
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

537
00:39:58,009 --> 00:39:59,927
One.

538
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:05,065
You once said

539
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,819
that without me, this city would
have faced certain defeat.

540
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:12,439
You said the histories
would never mention me,

541
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:15,109
but you would not forget.

542
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:19,079
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

543
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,701
Sadly, my lord,

544
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:26,453
I never forget a thing.

545
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:38,599
We will adjourn for now.

546
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:42,553
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

547
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:44,772
<i>Clear the court!</i>

548
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:07,211
<i>You'd condemn
your own son to death?</i>

549
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:09,413
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

550
00:41:09,464 --> 00:41:10,964
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

551
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:13,300
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

552
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:14,752
I know nothing of the sort.

553
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:17,304
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

554
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:19,173
As did I.

555
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:21,759
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

556
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,661
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

557
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,181
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

558
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:29,983
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

559
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:33,187
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

560
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:36,273
If Tyrion is found guilty, he
will be punished accordingly.

561
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:38,892
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

562
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:44,498
Once you said family
is what lives on.

563
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:46,533
All that lives on.

564
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:50,037
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

565
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:52,956
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

566
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:55,876
I'm a Kingsguard,

567
00:41:55,878 --> 00:41:57,795
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

568
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,546
I'm well aware of your oath.

569
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:01,682
What happens to your name?

570
00:42:01,716 --> 00:42:05,052
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

571
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:07,054
Your nephews?

572
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:08,689
Lancel Lannister?

573
00:42:08,723 --> 00:42:10,941
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

574
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:12,643
What happens to my dynasty

575
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:14,912
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

576
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:17,531
It survives through me.

577
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,902
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

578
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:24,738
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

579
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,624
if you let Tyrion live.

580
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:29,126
Done.

581
00:42:30,662 --> 00:42:34,248
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

582
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,999
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

583
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,053
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow
him to join the Night's Watch.

584
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:44,591
<i>In three days' time, he'll
depart for Castle Black</i>

585
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,310
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

586
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:48,929
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

587
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,931
<i>You will leave King's Landing</i>

588
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:53,183
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

589
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:55,652
You will marry a suitable woman

590
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:58,739
and father children
named Lannister.

591
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:02,659
And you'll never turn your
back on your family again.

592
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:09,283
You have my word.

593
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:11,118
And you have mine.

594
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:37,361
Not going well, is it?

595
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:39,863
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

596
00:43:39,898 --> 00:43:42,649
When you are, you need to
enter a formal plea for mercy

597
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,952
and ask to be sent to the Wall.

598
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:46,954
Father's agreed to it.

599
00:43:46,988 --> 00:43:49,706
He'll spare your life and allow
you to join the Night's Watch.

600
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:52,376
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

601
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,378
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

602
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:56,330
<i>Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.</i>

603
00:43:56,332 --> 00:43:58,165
How do you know?

604
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,887
Do you trust me?

605
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:09,426
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

606
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:11,511
This will all be over soon.

607
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:30,364
The crown may call
its next witness.

608
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:06,900
State your name.

609
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:08,902
Shae.

610
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:11,121
Do you swear by all the gods

611
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:13,707
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

612
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:16,576
I swear it.

613
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:18,412
Do you know this man?

614
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:29,323
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

615
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:31,174
How do you know him?

616
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:34,478
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

617
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:38,598
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

618
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,817
What do you know of this?

619
00:45:42,437 --> 00:45:44,738
I know that he's guilty.

620
00:45:46,074 --> 00:45:48,158
He and Sansa
planned it together.

621
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,945
<i>Silence!</i>

622
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:54,498
<i>Continue.</i>

623
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:57,451
<i>She wanted revenge
for her father,</i>

624
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:58,952
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

625
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:01,788
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

626
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,207
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

627
00:46:04,258 --> 00:46:07,878
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

628
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:10,947
He hated you, my lord.

629
00:46:10,982 --> 00:46:14,134
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

630
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:16,036
to put in Joffrey's wine.

631
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,605
<i>How could you
possibly know all this?</i>

632
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,442
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

633
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:26,496
I wasn't just her maid.

634
00:46:29,317 --> 00:46:30,984
I was his whore.

635
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:33,987
<i> I beg your pardon?</i>

636
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:35,655
You said you were his...

637
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:37,541
His whore.

638
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,879
How did you come
to be in his service?

639
00:46:42,914 --> 00:46:44,214
He stole me.

640
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:45,749
I was with another man,

641
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,334
a knight in
your lordship's army.

642
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:49,886
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

643
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:52,139
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

644
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:56,676
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

645
00:46:56,678 --> 00:46:59,179
"You belong to me now," he said.

646
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,183
"I want you to fuck me like it's
my last night in this world."

647
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:08,655
Silence.
Silence!

648
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:11,575
And did you?

649
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:14,111
Did I what?

650
00:47:14,162 --> 00:47:16,830
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

651
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:21,334
I did everything he wanted.

652
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:23,420
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

653
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,316
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

654
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:27,437
<i>I kissed him where he wanted.</i>

655
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:28,959
<i>I licked him where he wanted.</i>

656
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,394
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

657
00:47:32,445 --> 00:47:34,363
I was his property.

658
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:36,615
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

659
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:38,484
so he could use me
when he was bored.

660
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:42,454
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

661
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:46,158
I took his face
in my hands and said,

662
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:49,244
"I am yours
and you are mine."

663
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:54,500
Shae.

664
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,755
Please don't.

665
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:04,309
I am a whore.

666
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:06,929
<i>Remember?</i>

667
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:10,933
That was before
he married Sansa.

668
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,602
After that,
all he wanted was her.

669
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:16,188
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

670
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:20,442
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

671
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:34,289
I wish to confess.

672
00:48:35,508 --> 00:48:38,793
I wish...
to confess.

673
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:43,465
You wish to confess?

674
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:46,968
I saved you.

675
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:51,022
I saved this city

676
00:48:51,057 --> 00:48:54,559
and all your worthless lives.

677
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,113
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

678
00:48:58,147 --> 00:49:00,782
Tyrion.

679
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:06,154
Do you wish to confess?

680
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:12,294
Yes, Father.

681
00:49:12,328 --> 00:49:14,829
I'm guilty.

682
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,832
Guilty. Is that what
you want to hear?

683
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:19,968
You admit you poisoned the king?

684
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,554
No, of that I'm innocent.

685
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:26,591
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

686
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:30,095
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

687
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:33,682
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

688
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,951
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

689
00:49:35,985 --> 00:49:40,188
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

690
00:49:41,407 --> 00:49:43,108
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

691
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:44,542
<i>Nothing but this...</i>

692
00:49:44,577 --> 00:49:47,529
I did not do it.

693
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:50,498
I did not kill Joffrey,

694
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:52,834
but I wish that I had.

695
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:55,704
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

696
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:59,841
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

697
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:07,215
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

698
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:12,187
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

699
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:14,389
I would gladly give my life

700
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:16,725
to watch you all swallow it.

701
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:18,777
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

702
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:22,923
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

703
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:27,345
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

704
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:30,598
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

705
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:33,884
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

706
00:50:35,304 --> 00:50:38,773
I demand a trial by combat.

707
00:50:55,974 --> 00:51:03,053
