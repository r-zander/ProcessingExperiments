1
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:05,196
I want you to tell me
the truth about Joffrey.

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,872
He's a monster.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,448
With the Tyrells beside us, no one 
will think of rebelling for another century.

4
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,635
Ser Dontos of House Hollard.

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,770
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,640
It would be bad luck to kill a man
on your name day.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,160
You'll be my new fool!

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,432
Thank you, Your Grace.

9
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,976
Do you know
what it takes to unite 19 clans?

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,597
I told them we were all going to die

11
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,350
if we don't get south.

12
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,828
Let us go, and my father will pay you
whatever you want.

13
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,736
Enough to buy me a new head?

14
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,959
_

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,275
_

16
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,119
We need to find Sansa Stark a husband.

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,641
Tyrion'll do as he's bid,
you'll marry Ser Loras.

18
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:57,472
- I am not some brood mare...
- You're my daughter!

19
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,857
My feelings for you have not changed.

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,086
I'm not your lady,
I'm your whore.

21
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:04,336
He's a crow, he'll stab us in the back.

22
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,712
Kill him!

23
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:11,971
That's a fine little blade.

24
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,735
- No!
- Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,700
- Something wrong with your leg, boy?
- You've got to carry me.

26
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:21,937
Robb!

27
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:28,020
The Lannisters send their regards!

28
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:32,877
It's too late!

29
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:38,307
- You know I didn't have a choice...
- You know nothing, Jon Snow!

30
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,266
You're home.

31
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:30,560

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

32
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,712
- Magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.

33
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,914
Looks fresh-forged.

34
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,348
It is.

35
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,485
No one's made a Valyrian
steel sword

36
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,087
since the Doom of Valyria.

37
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,822
There are three living smiths

38
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,024
who know how to rework
Valyrian steel.

39
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:03,626
The finest of them
was in Volantis.

40
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:06,663
Came here to King's Landing
at my invitation.

41
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,898
Where did you get
this much Valyrian steel?

42
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,668
From someone who no longer
had need of it.

43
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,973
You've wanted one of these
in the family for a long time.

44
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,908
- And now we have two.
- Two?

45
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,478
The original weapon
was absurdly large.

46
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,880
Plenty of steel for two swords.

47
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:26,950
Well, thank you.
It's glorious.

48
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,824
You'll have to train
your left hand.

49
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,360
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

50
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,429
You'll never be as good.

51
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,164
No.

52
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:42,958
But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,

53
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,634
I suppose it doesn't matter.

54
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,871
You can't serve in the Kingsguard
with one hand.

55
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:50,240
Where's that written?
I can and I will.

56
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,441
The Kingsguard oath
is for life.

57
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:53,643
The war is over.
The king is safe.

58
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,378
The king is never safe.

59
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,914
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

60
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,383
Other knights protected the king
while you were a prisoner.

61
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,319
They will continue
to do so when you go home.

62
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:06,823
- Home?
- You'll return to Casterly Rock

63
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,125
<i>and rule in my stead.</i>

64
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,327
You are the Lord
of Casterly Rock.

65
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,999
I am the King's Hand.
My place is here.

66
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,569
I don't expect to see
the Rock again before I die.

67
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:22,138
You know what they call me?

68
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,440
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.

69
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,109
Man without honor.

70
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,778
Now you want me to break
another sacred vow.

71
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:31,381
You won't be breaking anything.

72
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,450
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

73
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:37,554
The king will exercise
that prerogative.

74
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,156
- No.
- No?

75
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,991
No.

76
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,370
I don't believe
I asked you a question.

77
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:46,201
There's my answer.

78
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:48,226
If you think your bloody
honor comes before...

79
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,333
My bloody honor
is beyond repair,

80
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,002
but my answer is still no.
I don't want Casterly Rock.

81
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,304
I don't want a wife.
I don't want children.

82
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:56,906
What do you want?

83
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,542
Supper would be nice.

84
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,947
For 40 years
I've tried to teach you.

85
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,216
If you haven't learned by now,
you never will.

86
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:08,384
Go.

87
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,386
<i>If serving as a glorified</i>
<i>bodyguard</i>

88
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,089
is the sum of your ambition,
go serve.

89
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:15,792
I suppose you want
the sword back.

90
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,994
Keep it.

91
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,863
A one-handed man
with no family needs

92
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,468
all the help he can get.

93
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:51,761
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

94
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,830
Please don't.

95
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:56,966
<i>Seems to me</i>
<i>the smart place</i>

96
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,935
<i>to meet travelers</i>
<i>is in a tavern.</i>

97
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,803
That way, one party is late,

98
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,239
the other party can drink
some ale inside.

99
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:04,974
This is the Prince of Dorne
we're waiting for,

100
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,410
not one of your
sellsword friends.

101
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:10,647
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?

102
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,718
There's bad blood between
the Martells of Dorne

103
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:18,388
and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.

104
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:20,657
And just in case
the Martells of Dorne

105
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,625
are looking to spill
some Lannister blood,

106
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,061
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

107
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,587
I happen to be
an accomplished diplomat.

108
00:09:26,612 --> 00:09:27,830
Oh.

109
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,700
Ah, here we are.

110
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:35,638
<i>Can you read the sigils?</i>

111
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:38,975
Yellow balls?

112
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,710
Wild lemons on a purple field,

113
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:43,046
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

114
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,483
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
House Blackmont.

115
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,386
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

116
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,155
Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

117
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:53,723
I need a sigil.

118
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:57,327
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?

119
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:58,828
I don't see it, my lord.

120
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,608
Well met, my lords.

121
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,999
His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

122
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:09,372
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

123
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,641
I am Tyrion Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

124
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,410
Master of Coin.

125
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:17,767
Forgive me.

126
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,767
I don't see Prince Doran
in your company.

127
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:25,021
The prince's health
forces him to remain at Sunspear.

128
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:28,191
He sends his brother
Prince Oberyn

129
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:31,060
<i>to attend the royal</i>
<i>wedding in his stead.</i>

130
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,999
Yes, the king will be delighted
to enjoy the company

131
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,267
of a warrior
as renowned as Prince Oberyn

132
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,169
at his wedding feast.

133
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,270
Will he?

134
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:44,273
And where is Prince Oberyn?

135
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,708
Arrived before dawn.

136
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:48,344
Not a man for welcome parties,

137
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,313
<i>our prince.</i>

138
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:54,017
Very well. My lords, these
fine men from the City Watch

139
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,586
will escort you to your
quarters in the Red Keep.

140
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,722
You must be weary
after such a long journey.

141
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,763
Some accomplished
diplomacy that was.

142
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,464
Now where?

143
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,812
We must find Prince Oberyn
before he kills somebody

144
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,468
or several somebodies.

145
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,571
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in a city this big?

146
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:17,740
You're famous for fucking
half of Westeros.

147
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,810
You just arrived at the capital after
two weeks of bad roads,

148
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:22,278
where would you go?

149
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,448
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

150
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:51,541
Look at this one.

151
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:55,111
How lovely is she?

152
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,013
Beautiful.

153
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:58,781
But pale.

154
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,783
They like them pale
in the capital.

155
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:03,386
Shows they don't
work the fields.

156
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,057
Do I frighten you?

157
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,260
You like?

158
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,497
Timid.
Timid bores me.

159
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:23,039
You're a bit of mischief,
aren't you?

160
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,210
I think she likes you.

161
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,911
She has good taste.

162
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:33,783
You're not timid, are you?

163
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:39,922
Not timid.

164
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:41,791
Do you like women?

165
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,759
When they look
like her, my lord.

166
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,995
This one will do nicely.

167
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,064
<i>Very good, my lady.</i>

168
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:50,333
Oh, I'm not a lady.

169
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,635
A term of courtesy
in this establishment.

170
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,537
A lie anywhere.

171
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:56,973
Why not use the right words?

172
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,608
I'm a bastard.

173
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:02,311
She is a whore.
And you're what?

174
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,480
A procurer.

175
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,115
Any of the others?

176
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:09,886
The two girls can leave.

177
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,854
You stay.

178
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,458
I'm afraid I'm not
an offer, my lord.

179
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:18,528
Everyone who works
for Littlefinger is an offer.

180
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:21,330
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

181
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:24,500
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

182
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,303
Have you ever been
with a prince?

183
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,506
Can't say I have.

184
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:36,512
I'm wildly expensive.

185
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,116
Take off your clothes.

186
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,258
Which way do you like it?

187
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,296
My way.

188
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,733
<i>* And so he spoke</i>
<i>and so he spoke *</i>

189
00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:01,938
<i>* That Lord of Castamere *</i>

190
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:04,574
- <i>* And now the rains... *</i>
- Oberyn.

191
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:07,543
- <i>* Weep o'er his hall... *</i>
- Oberyn, don't.

192
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:11,280
<i>* With no one there to hear *</i>

193
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:16,319
* Yes, not the rains
weep o'er his hall *

194
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:22,525
* And not a soul to hear. *

195
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,801
You lost, friend?

196
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,770
Forgive me for staring.

197
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,473
I don't see many
Lannisters where I'm from.

198
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,243
I don't see many
Dornishmen in the capital.

199
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:43,579
We don't like the smell.

200
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:46,349
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

201
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:48,684
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.

202
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,987
Why are you wasting a woman
like this on a Dornishman?

203
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,122
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

204
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:01,631
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

205
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:10,940
You think your gold
and your lions

206
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:14,477
and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

207
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,981
May I tell you a secret?

208
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:21,450
You're not a golden lion.

209
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,020
You're just a pink little man

210
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:26,389
who is far too slow
on the draw.

211
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:38,701
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

212
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,003
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

213
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,673
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

214
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:47,977
He'll live if you
get him help straightaway.

215
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,648
So, decisions.

216
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,085
Prince Oberyn,
forgive the intrusion.

217
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:58,087
We heard there might be...

218
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,222
...trouble.

219
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:03,526
Apologies, my love.

220
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,734
I'm here to welcome you
to the capital.

221
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:19,108
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

222
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,078
The king's own Uncle Imp.

223
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:25,014
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

224
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,682
If there's anything
I can do to make your stay...

225
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,484
What are you?
His hired killer?

226
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:31,954
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.

227
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,255
How did that come to pass?

228
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,624
Killed the right people,
I suppose.

229
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:43,466
We'll need a few more girls.
Girls, yes?

230
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,867
You don't partake?

231
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,603
Oh, I partook.
Now I'm married.

232
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,973
Prince Oberyn, if I may,
a word in private?

233
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,713
Seems I visited
the Lannister brothel by mistake.

234
00:16:57,748 --> 00:17:00,216
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

235
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,411
The king is very grateful
that you traveled all

236
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,886
this way for his wedding.

237
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,856
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

238
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,892
I am only the second son
after all.

239
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,961
Well, speaking
as a fellow second son,

240
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,331
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

241
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,868
Why did you come
to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

242
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,369
I was invited
to the royal wedding.

243
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:23,005
I thought we were
speaking truth.

244
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:27,276
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

245
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,345
Another wedding.

246
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,514
My sister Elia

247
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:35,017
and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

248
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,823
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.

249
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:44,493
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

250
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:47,530
Elia wouldn't let
the wet nurse touch them.

251
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:51,100
And beautiful, noble
Rhaegar Targaryen

252
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:53,936
left her for another woman.

253
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,138
That started a war

254
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,941
and the war ended right here

255
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,243
when your father's army
took the city...

256
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:02,645
I wasn't actually present.

257
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,014
...and butchered
those children.

258
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,417
My nephew and niece.

259
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:12,588
Carved them up and wrapped them
in Lannister cloaks.

260
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:17,960
And my sister, you know
what they did to her?

261
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:22,531
I'm asking you a question.

262
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,700
I've heard rumors.

263
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:27,369
So have I.

264
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:31,340
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

265
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:34,310
raped Elia
and split her in half

266
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,678
with his great sword.

267
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,613
I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.

268
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,348
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

269
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:41,617
your father gave the order.

270
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,887
Tell your father I'm here.

271
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:50,192
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

272
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:21,090
Shh.

273
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,189
Shh. Shh.

274
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,510
They're dragons, Khaleesi.

275
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:17,346
They can never be tamed.

276
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,082
Not even by their mother.

277
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,405
- Ser Barristan.
- Your Grace.

278
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:46,742
Where's Daario Naharis?

279
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,510
Where's Grey Worm?

280
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,414
Gambling, Your Grace.

281
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,484
Gambling?

282
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:20,976
Mhysa. Mhysa.
Mhysa...

283
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,553
How long have they been at it?

284
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:33,856
Since midnight, Your Grace.

285
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,525
Ser Worm is stronger
than he looks.

286
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,427
But I can see his arms
beginning to shake.

287
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,829
What's the prize to winning
this stupid contest?

288
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,998
The honor of riding by your side
on the road to Meereen.

289
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,602
That honor goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan

290
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,971
as neither of them kept
me waiting this morning.

291
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:52,541
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

292
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,311
The last man holding his sword

293
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,881
can find a new queen
to fight for.

294
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,221
_

295
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,430
_

296
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,527
_

297
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,760
_

298
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,056
_

299
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:29,878
You need to eat something.

300
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,050
Pigeon pie.

301
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:37,319
No, thank you.

302
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,292
Lemon cakes?

303
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:45,027
No, thank you.

304
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,929
You love lemon cakes.

305
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:49,732
Tell her she needs to eat.

306
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:51,500
My lady, you do need to eat.

307
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:53,469
I don't need to eat.

308
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:58,574
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

309
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,985
She needs to eat.

310
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,194
I can't let you starve.

311
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,163
<i>I swore to protect you.</i>

312
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,038
My lady,

313
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:32,374
I am your husband.
Let me help you.

314
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,311
How can you help me?

315
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:38,981
I don't know, but I can try.

316
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,987
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy

317
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,856
thinking about how they died.

318
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:51,226
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

319
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,428
Do you know what
they did to my brother?

320
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:58,801
How they sewed his direwolf's
head onto his body?

321
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,271
And my mother.

322
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:04,873
They say they cut
her throat to the bone

323
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:08,010
and threw her body
in the river.

324
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:12,047
<i>What happened to your family</i>
<i>was a terrible crime.</i>

325
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,346
I didn't know your brother.

326
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,372
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

327
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:18,387
<i>Your mother, on the other hand,</i>

328
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,422
<i>I admired her.</i>

329
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,658
She wanted to have me executed,

330
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,693
but I admired her.

331
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,463
She was a strong woman.

332
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,599
And she was fierce

333
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,801
when it came
to protecting her children.

334
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:37,306
Sansa.

335
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,877
Your mother would want
you to carry on.

336
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,245
You know it's true.

337
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:49,985
Will you pardon me, my lord?

338
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,587
I'd like to visit the godswood.

339
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,723
Of course. Of course.
Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

340
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:57,459
I don't pray anymore.

341
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:01,063
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

342
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,516
My lion.

343
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:24,052
What are you doing?

344
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:30,459
What does it look like
I'm doing? Come here.

345
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:33,161
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

346
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,830
I know.
I know.

347
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:37,132
We have come
to a dangerous place.

348
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,635
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?

349
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:40,969
Of course I haven't forgotten.

350
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:43,305
I want you.

351
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,806
Don't you want me?

352
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,877
Things are a bit tense
right now.

353
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:51,046
What things?

354
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,148
My nephew the king
wants to murder me.

355
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,817
My wife hates me because my father
murdered her family.

356
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:57,697
Oberyn Martell wants
to murder everyone whose

357
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,321
last name is Lannister.

358
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:03,825
You need to relax.

359
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,603
Don't you want to relax?

360
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,010
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

361
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:24,513
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

362
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:27,616
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

363
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,218
- Do you love her?
- Love her?

364
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,421
I barely know her.
She's a child.

365
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:35,090
- She despises me.
- That's not an answer.

366
00:26:35,124 --> 00:26:37,326
Of course I don't love her.

367
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,394
You tried to ship me away.

368
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,530
Ship you away?

369
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:45,367
Give me diamonds
and make me disappear.

370
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:47,235
What in the world
are you talking about?

371
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,171
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

372
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,975
- Say it!
- Shh.

373
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:55,077
I don't know what
you're talking about.

374
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,746
You want me to stay?

375
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:28,377
A work of art, really.

376
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,245
The craftsmanship is excellent.

377
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,673
You like it so much,

378
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:33,660
you're welcome to chop off
your own hand and take it.

379
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,650
Such an ingrate.
I spent days with the goldsmith

380
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:38,286
- getting the details just right.
- Days?

381
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:41,222
Better part of an afternoon.

382
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:43,892
There, how does that feel?

383
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:45,760
Uh...

384
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,029
a hook would be more practical.

385
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:49,931
Elegant, I think.

386
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,681
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

387
00:27:57,706 --> 00:27:59,874
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

388
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:01,409
I am in your debt,
Maester Qyburn.

389
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,778
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help

390
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,680
whenever I can.

391
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,291
Odd little man.

392
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:18,293
I've grown rather fond of him.

393
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:20,228
He's quite talented, you know?

394
00:28:20,262 --> 00:28:21,896
What symptoms?

395
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:24,265
Symptoms that are
not your concern.

396
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,534
You let him touch you?

397
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,736
You jealous?

398
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:30,471
I'm surprised.

399
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:31,906
You never let Pycelle near you.

400
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:34,075
You think I'd let
that old lecher

401
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,344
put his hands on me?

402
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,947
He smells like a dead cat.

403
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:41,349
<i>I'm not sure I've ever</i>
<i>smelled a dead cat.</i>

404
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,585
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

405
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,321
You drink more
than you used to.

406
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,389
- Yes.
- Why?

407
00:28:48,424 --> 00:28:52,660
Let's see, you started
a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark

408
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,796
and disappeared
from the capital.

409
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,365
My husband died in a tragic
hunting accident.

410
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,100
It must have been
traumatic for you.

411
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,535
My only daughter
was shipped off to Dorne.

412
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,203
<i>We suffered through a siege.</i>

413
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:03,871
A rather short siege.

414
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:06,240
A rather short siege
that I didn't expect to survive.

415
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:08,209
And now I'm marrying
my eldest son

416
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,378
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden

417
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:12,513
while I'm supposed
to marry her brother,

418
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:15,149
a renowned pillow biter.
So...

419
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,752
Father disowned me today.

420
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:20,154
He can't disown you.
You're all he's got.

421
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,657
You're forgetting Tyrion.

422
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:26,427
You don't really plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?

423
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:33,935
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here

424
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:36,304
in the Red Keep with you.

425
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:39,607
- Not now.
- I want...

426
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:42,844
Not now? When?
I've been back for weeks.

427
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:49,550
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

428
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:52,553
You come back after all this time
with no apologies

429
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,089
and one hand and expect
everything to be the same?

430
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,424
What do you want me
to apologize for?

431
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,892
For leaving me.

432
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,427
You think I wanted
to be taken prisoner?

433
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:01,362
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

434
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,931
You left me alone.

435
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:07,568
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

436
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:10,905
Every day. I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

437
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,508
- You took too long.
- I...

438
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:17,578
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you took too long.

439
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,915
- Come in.
<i>- Go away.</i>

440
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,151
Forgive me, Your Grace.

441
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:26,754
You told me to come
at once if there was anything important.

442
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:49,143
You plan on killing
all the crows yourself?

443
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,881
Do you plan on sitting
here scratching your balls till winter?

444
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,917
We wait for Mance's orders.

445
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:57,952
You sent a man over the Wall
at the full moon.

446
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,921
<i>If he's not back yet,</i>
<i>he's not coming back.</i>

447
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:01,456
<i>And what is it you want?</i>

448
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,958
March on Castle Black
with just this lot?

449
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,994
Your pretty crow
said 1,000 men are nesting there.

450
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,763
Yeah, well, he's a liar.

451
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:10,498
He is?

452
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,867
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

453
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,670
You said you put
three arrows in him.

454
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:17,338
I did.

455
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:20,942
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

456
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:25,346
If that boy's still walking,
it's 'cause you let him go.

457
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:52,306
Thenns.

458
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,842
I fucking hate Thenns.

459
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:06,921
Mance sent you?

460
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:09,390
How did you find us?

461
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:16,831
You came from the south,
not the north.

462
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,200
Took a detour.

463
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:22,670
Got some supper from
a village down that way.

464
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,742
<i>Why does the meat down here</i>
<i>taste so much better</i>

465
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:29,944
than it does
on our side of the Wall?

466
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:31,646
Help yourself.

467
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:37,318
Maybe everything's
just better fed down here.

468
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:40,688
Fat and lazy.

469
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:43,991
Easier for us, hmm?

470
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:48,462
You didn't see us coming?

471
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,264
Lost your warg?

472
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:55,203
And that baby crow
you had with you,

473
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:57,605
lost him too?

474
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,742
I'll answer to Mance.

475
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:03,778
I won't answer to you.

476
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:06,447
She yours?

477
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,585
I'm not anybody's.

478
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:21,729
Too scrawny.

479
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:25,399
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.

480
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:29,170
<i>Think of them</i>
<i>stuck in their larders</i>

481
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:32,340
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

482
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:35,910
and stew, getting nice and fat

483
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:37,612
and marbled.

484
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:41,549
I know we've had
our differences, Tormund,

485
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,920
but just one time
before you die,

486
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:50,124
you really ought to try crow.

487
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,695
<i>Draw.</i>

488
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,631
Loose.

489
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:04,705
<i>Last time I saw him,</i>

490
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,008
<i>he was in the courtyard</i>
<i>at Winterfell.</i>

491
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,445
<i>He said, "Next time I see you,</i>

492
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,348
<i>you'll be all in black."</i>

493
00:34:16,485 --> 00:34:19,120
I was jealous of Robb
my whole life.

494
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:22,623
<i>The way my father</i>
<i>looked at him,</i>

495
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,625
<i>I wanted that.</i>

496
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,795
He was better than me
at everything...

497
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,366
fighting and hunting

498
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:35,002
and riding

499
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,837
and girls.

500
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:39,907
<i>Gods, the girls loved him.</i>

501
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:44,211
I wanted to hate him,
but I never could.

502
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:49,383
Sometimes I want to hate you.

503
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:55,189
Well, you're better
than me at everything.

504
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,793
Except reading.

505
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:05,099
They're...
they're ready for you.

506
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,973
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

507
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,307
No one's going to hang you.

508
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:14,809
You've done nothing wrong.

509
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:17,712
I've done plenty wrong.

510
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:22,283
So you admit you
murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

511
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,051
<i>I didn't murder him.</i>

512
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:26,554
No?
You put your sword

513
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:28,522
through a brother
of the Night's Watch.

514
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:30,591
What do you call that?

515
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,727
He wanted me to kill him.

516
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,562
A bastard son of a traitor.

517
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:35,997
What would you expect?

518
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,932
The Halfhand believed
our only chance

519
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,234
to stop Mance was to get
a man inside his army.

520
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,299
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as if you knew him.

521
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:43,523
He was my brother.

522
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:46,374
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

523
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:49,210
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

524
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:51,379
<i>The free folk?</i>
<i>Listen to him.</i>

525
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:53,948
He even talks like
a wildling now.

526
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:56,717
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

527
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:59,353
I climbed the Wall
with the wildlings. I...

528
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:02,823
I laid with a wildling girl.

529
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,528
You admit to breaking
your vows, then?

530
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:09,830
I do.

531
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:13,801
The law is the law.
The boy must die.

532
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:17,972
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

533
00:36:18,006 --> 00:36:21,742
the Wall would be manned
by headless men.

534
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:23,911
There's a difference
between sneaking off

535
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:27,748
to the Mole's Town brothel
and sleeping with the enemy.

536
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,217
While we sit here

537
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:32,686
debating which rules I broke,

538
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:36,257
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

539
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:37,691
Impossible.

540
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,894
You can't get
50 wildlings together

541
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:41,429
before they start
killing each other.

542
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:44,832
100,000.
He's united the Thenns,

543
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,467
<i>the Hornfoots,</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

544
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,968
He has giants fighting for him.

545
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:50,071
Giants?

546
00:36:51,273 --> 00:36:53,507
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?

547
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:55,676
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

548
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,606
And now you're here.

549
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,546
You must not have been
very good at your job.

550
00:36:58,547 --> 00:36:59,747
How dare you?!

551
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,883
There's a band of wildlings
south of the Wall already

552
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:04,952
led by Tormund Giantsbane.

553
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:06,687
I killed their warg
and three others.

554
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:09,023
They shot me full of arrows.

555
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:12,660
Their orders are to attack
Castle Black from the south

556
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,995
when Mance hits
it from the north.

557
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,531
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

558
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,900
Mance said it would be
the greatest fire

559
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,335
the North has ever seen.

560
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,004
<i>That's the truth.</i>

561
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,773
All the truth.

562
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:33,614
Do you intend to execute me
or am I free to go?

563
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:35,950
None of us are free.

564
00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:37,818
We are men
of the Night's Watch.

565
00:37:37,853 --> 00:37:42,156
But we won't be taking
your head today, Jon Snow.

566
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,724
Go on.

567
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:56,937
I am acting commander here,
Maester Aemon.

568
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,839
Yes, you are.

569
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,741
And I don't trust the bastard.

570
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:03,811
He told the truth.

571
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:06,013
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

572
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,382
How did you acquire
this magical power?

573
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:12,953
I grew up in King's Landing.

574
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,325
<i>No. No.</i>

575
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,061
You're a queen, not an ox.

576
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:24,398
Your grandfather
gave me a necklace

577
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:27,801
just like this one
for my 51st nameday.

578
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:31,438
The wedding is in
a fortnight, Grandmother.

579
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:33,507
You can't say no to everything.

580
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,177
Nonsense.
My little dears.

581
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:39,180
Go and speak to the jewelers
of King's Landing.

582
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:41,782
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.

583
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,984
The one who brings
me the best necklace

584
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:46,654
will get to keep the next best.

585
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:53,694
The Margaery Tyrell
who walks into the sept

586
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:57,231
a fortnight from now
will inspire 1,000 songs.

587
00:38:57,265 --> 00:39:00,701
Now, how sad it will be if
she's wearing rubbish like that.

588
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:04,171
Perhaps I should just let
Joffrey choose it for me.

589
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,487
End up with a string
of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

590
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:10,077
You watch that.
Even here, even with me.

591
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,148
My word.

592
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:16,850
My lady.
My lady.

593
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:19,853
Please pardon me
for interrupting.

594
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:21,689
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

595
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:23,357
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

596
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,926
But hearing is one thing.

597
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,629
Aren't you just marvelous?

598
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:31,966
Absolutely singular.

599
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,568
I hear you knocked
my grandson into the dirt

600
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:37,805
like the silly little
boy he is.

601
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,241
My lady, I know this is
a very busy time for you,

602
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:42,977
but if I could
just have a moment.

603
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:46,013
You dare not refuse.

604
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,117
A shadow?

605
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,753
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

606
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:58,058
I swear to you by all
the gods it was Stannis.

607
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:00,828
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart

608
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:03,364
and disappeared.

609
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:06,300
One day, my lady,
I will avenge our king.

610
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:08,636
Joffrey is our king now.

611
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,838
I meant no offense.

612
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:12,740
And you've given none.

613
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,251
All the Kingsguard
will be on duty, of course.

614
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,086
Ser Boros
will be stationed here.

615
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:28,088
Ser Preston
will be stationed here

616
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:31,692
beside the primary
entertainment.

617
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:35,095
Your Grace?

618
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,698
Yes, yes,
one guard at the...

619
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,533
the thing.
Go on.

620
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,770
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

621
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:45,439
I've always guarded
the king himself, my lord.

622
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:47,675
Ever since your absence.

623
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,777
And I thank you
for it, Ser Meryn.

624
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:52,513
All very good.
I don't expect any trouble.

625
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,315
The people love their king.

626
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,849
They know who keeps them fed.

627
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:57,885
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

628
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:00,888
By my leave.

629
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:04,091
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.

630
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,093
The war's not won.
Not while Stannis lives.

631
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:08,495
I broke Stannis
on the Blackwater.

632
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,931
Pity you weren't
there to help, Uncle.

633
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:13,701
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

634
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:15,936
Busy getting captured.

635
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:19,973
So this is the famous
"Book of Brothers"?

636
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:22,976
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

637
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,083
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.

638
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:34,121
Led the attack
on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

639
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:36,490
Defeated the Smiling Knight
in single combat.

640
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:39,259
Ser Duncan the Tall.

641
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,697
Four pages for Ser Duncan.

642
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:45,299
He must have been quite a man.

643
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,167
So they say.

644
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:51,672
Ser Jaime Lannister.

645
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,746
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

646
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,715
- There's still time.
- Is there?

647
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,918
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

648
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,122
How can you protect me
with that?

649
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,723
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

650
00:42:09,758 --> 00:42:11,992
Makes for more of a contest.

651
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:31,678
Have you ever been
to Meereen?

652
00:42:31,713 --> 00:42:34,148
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

653
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:35,582
And?

654
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:37,785
They say 1,000 slaves died

655
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,620
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

656
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:41,889
And now an army
of former slaves

657
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:44,291
is marching to her gates.

658
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:46,527
You think the Great
Masters are worried?

659
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,530
If they're smart, Your Grace.

660
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:55,536
You were told to ride
at the back of the train.

661
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,304
Yes, my queen.

662
00:42:57,338 --> 00:43:00,107
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

663
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:03,076
A matter of strategy.

664
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:08,615
Your Grace.

665
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:14,822
All right, what is this
matter of strategy?

666
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:19,793
A dusk rose.

667
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:22,229
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

668
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:25,265
And this one's called
lady's lace.

669
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,367
Would you like
to walk without shoes?

670
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:29,636
You have to know
a land to rule it.

671
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:31,772
Its plants, its rivers,

672
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:34,508
its roads, its people.

673
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,910
Dusk rose tea eases fever.

674
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:38,679
Everyone in Meereen knows that.

675
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,014
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

676
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,549
If you want them to follow you,

677
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:44,218
you have to become
a part of their world.

678
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:45,619
Strategy.

679
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:50,457
Harpy's Gold.

680
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:52,092
No tea from this one.

681
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:54,394
Beautiful but poisonous.

682
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:02,936
You are a gambler, aren't you?

683
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:12,613
Your Grace.

684
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:47,481
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

685
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:50,817
How many miles are there between
here and Meereen?

686
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:54,254
163, Your Grace.

687
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:56,423
<i>I'll tell our men to ride</i>
<i>ahead and bury them.</i>

688
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:57,958
You don't need to see this.

689
00:44:57,992 --> 00:45:01,061
You will do no such thing.

690
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:04,798
I will see each
and every one of their faces.

691
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:09,069
Remove her collar
before you bury her.

692
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:17,744
<i>There she is.</i>

693
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:20,113
Yes, there she is.

694
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:24,384
- And?
- You made a promise.

695
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,621
To return the Stark girls
to their mother who is now dead.

696
00:45:27,655 --> 00:45:29,222
To keep them safe.

697
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:31,224
Well, Arya Stark
hasn't been seen

698
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:32,926
since her father was killed.

699
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,596
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

700
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,731
There's a certain safety
in death, wouldn't you say?

701
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:41,034
And Sansa Stark is now
Sansa Lannister.

702
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,869
Bit of a complication.

703
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:45,439
A complication does not
release you from a vow.

704
00:45:45,473 --> 00:45:47,674
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?

705
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:50,410
And take her where?
Where would she be safer than here?

706
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:52,245
Look me in the eye and tell me

707
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,581
that you think she'll be
safe in King's Landing.

708
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:03,690
Are you sure we're not related?

709
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:05,993
Ever since I've returned,
every Lannister I've seen

710
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:07,628
has been a miserable
pain in my ass.

711
00:46:07,662 --> 00:46:09,162
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

712
00:46:09,197 --> 00:46:12,032
You've got the hair for it
if not the looks.

713
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:05,552
It's all right.

714
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:07,688
It's all right.
It's all right.

715
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,925
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

716
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:14,428
I have good reason to be.

717
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:18,265
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

718
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,202
Don't you know me?

719
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:27,708
Ser Dontos.
The king's nameday celebration.

720
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:30,010
I'm sorry.
I should have remembered.

721
00:47:30,044 --> 00:47:32,079
I can't accept your apology.

722
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:35,582
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

723
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:37,984
Anyone would have
done the same.

724
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:39,953
But only you did.

725
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,489
I can never repay you.

726
00:47:42,523 --> 00:47:45,859
You gave me my life.
But this,

727
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:49,129
this is worth
more than my life.

728
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:54,501
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.

729
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:56,403
House Hollard was strong once.

730
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:58,438
House on the rise.

731
00:47:58,473 --> 00:48:01,007
That's all that's left
of those days,

732
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:04,878
thanks to a few sad,
fat drunks like me.

733
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:06,847
I can't take it.

734
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:09,950
It's very, very kind of you,
but I can't.

735
00:48:09,984 --> 00:48:12,152
I don't have
anything else left.

736
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:14,688
That's all.

737
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:16,423
Take it.
Wear it.

738
00:48:16,457 --> 00:48:19,025
Let my name have
one more moment in the sun

739
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,294
before it disappears
from the world.

740
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,168
I'll wear it with pride,
Ser Dontos.

741
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:30,470
Yeah.

742
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,441
<i>When am I going to get</i>
<i>a horse of my own?</i>

743
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,767
The little lady wants a pony.

744
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:03,603
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

745
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:06,540
Horses aren't easy to come by.

746
00:49:06,574 --> 00:49:07,579
Even if they were,

747
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:09,502
you think I'm gonna put
you on your own horse?

748
00:49:10,344 --> 00:49:13,814
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

749
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:16,683
Why don't you have any money?

750
00:49:16,717 --> 00:49:19,252
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey
before you left?

751
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:21,254
No.

752
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,323
You're not very smart, are you?

753
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:25,292
I'm not a thief.

754
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:27,327
You're fine with
murdering little boys,

755
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:29,229
but thieving is beneath you?

756
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:31,932
A man's got to have a code.

757
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:34,401
You think I'm gonna escape?

758
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:36,436
Where would I go?

759
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,405
I'd be dead by nightfall
without you.

760
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:40,907
My family's gone.
I've got no one.

761
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:44,211
You've got an aunt in the Vale.

762
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:47,447
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her,

763
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:49,482
maybe she'll have
enough left over

764
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,651
to buy you that pony
you want so much.

765
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:58,058
<i>I'm hungry.</i>
<i>You're hungry.</i>

766
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:00,627
Five horses, five men.

767
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:04,197
More than I feel like
killing on an empty stomach.

768
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:12,806
I know him.

769
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,575
<i>The small one.</i>
<i>His name is Polliver.</i>

770
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,712
He captured us
and took us to Harrenhal.

771
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:22,916
He killed Lommy.

772
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:24,718
What the fuck's a Lommy?

773
00:50:24,752 --> 00:50:27,287
He was my friend.

774
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:30,290
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.

775
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:33,793
He's still got it.

776
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:35,562
<i>Got what?</i>

777
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:37,464
My sword Needle.

778
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,334
Needle?
Of course you named your sword.

779
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:42,669
Lots of people
name their swords.

780
00:50:42,703 --> 00:50:44,838
Lots of cunts.

781
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:52,846
What are you...
get back here.

782
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,481
My brother gave me that sword.

783
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:57,217
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

784
00:50:57,251 --> 00:50:58,985
I don't care
if he ate your friend.

785
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,954
We're not going in there.

786
00:51:04,558 --> 00:51:07,260
<i>Come on, give it up.</i>

787
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:13,566
Come here.

788
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:16,670
- Let's have a feel there.
- Leave it.

789
00:51:45,866 --> 00:51:47,801
Come here.

790
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:51,638
Please, she's a good girl.

791
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:53,273
Shut your mouth
and pour us more ale

792
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:55,742
and we may not take
her with us when we're done with her.

793
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:02,649
I know you.

794
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,053
You're the Hound.

795
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:11,091
<i>Pour our new friend some ale.</i>

796
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:17,831
What brings you so far north?

797
00:52:17,865 --> 00:52:19,432
I could ask the same of you.

798
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:20,507
What are you doing up here?

799
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:22,135
Just keeping the king's peace.

800
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:23,903
No need.
The war's over.

801
00:52:23,938 --> 00:52:27,307
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.

802
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:29,342
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.

803
00:52:29,377 --> 00:52:30,610
And where am I for all of it?

804
00:52:30,644 --> 00:52:32,712
Stuck with your brother.

805
00:52:32,747 --> 00:52:35,315
- Meaning no offense.
- None taken.

806
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:37,017
He's good, the Mountain is.

807
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:38,518
Best at what he does.

808
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:41,821
But torture, torture,
torture, torture.

809
00:52:41,856 --> 00:52:44,591
<i>You spend enough time putting</i>
<i>the hammer to people,</i>

810
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:47,660
<i>you start to feel like</i>
<i>a carpenter making chairs.</i>

811
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:49,763
Drains the fun right out of it.

812
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,064
And what's life
without a little fun?

813
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,736
But I don't need
to tell you that, eh?

814
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:01,341
She's all right.
I've had better.

815
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:06,946
You know what?

816
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:08,815
You should come with us.

817
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:12,719
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

818
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:15,688
Gold, silver, more daughters.

819
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:18,191
<i>Always something if you</i>
<i>know how to make them talk.</i>

820
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:20,727
And there's plenty of him
between here and King's Landing.

821
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:22,462
You could do well for yourself.

822
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:24,297
We certainly have been.

823
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:29,869
I'm not going
to King's Landing.

824
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:32,572
Think about it.
We could do whatever we like

825
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:35,408
wherever we go.

826
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:37,377
These are the king's colors.

827
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,379
No one's standing
in his way now.

828
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:42,582
Which means no one's
standing in ours.

829
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:45,852
Fuck the king.

830
00:53:55,729 --> 00:53:58,164
When I heard that Joffrey's
dog had tucked tail

831
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:00,300
and run from the Battle
of the Blackwater,

832
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:02,402
I didn't believe it.

833
00:54:02,436 --> 00:54:05,138
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

834
00:54:05,172 --> 00:54:07,774
Bring me one of those chickens.

835
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:09,943
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

836
00:54:09,977 --> 00:54:12,378
No.

837
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:14,180
But we're the king's men.

838
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:17,750
So, you got money?

839
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:19,586
Not a penny.

840
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,489
I'll still take that chicken.

841
00:54:22,523 --> 00:54:24,224
Tell you what.

842
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,292
We'll trade you.

843
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:28,495
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

844
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:31,498
<i>Give us a go at your friend.</i>

845
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,901
Lowell there likes them
a bit broken in.

846
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:44,644
You're a talker.

847
00:54:45,913 --> 00:54:49,282
Listening to talkers
makes me thirsty.

848
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:06,900
Ah.

849
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:08,902
And hungry.

850
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:11,671
Think I'll take two chickens.

851
00:55:20,147 --> 00:55:22,849
You don't seem to
understand the situation.

852
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:25,518
I understand that
if any more words

853
00:55:25,553 --> 00:55:28,188
come pouring out
of your cunt mouth,

854
00:55:28,222 --> 00:55:31,925
I'm gonna have to eat
every fucking chicken in this room.

855
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:34,694
You lived your life
for the king.

856
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:38,364
You're gonna die
for some chickens?

857
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,601
Someone is.

858
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:41,854
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

859
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,856
What?
What do you mean?

860
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:46,859
Can you walk?
I've got to carry you?

861
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:48,695
Carry me?

862
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:52,799
Fine little blade.

863
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,606
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

864
00:58:49,523 --> 00:59:00,032
