00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:40,179
In old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

3
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,971
the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,

4
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,986
wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

5
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:51,332
It's just a statue.

6
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:59,957
Haha. Don't be afraid. He's
announcing our arrival.

7
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:04,715
I'm not afraid.

8
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:14,230
The House of Black and White.

9
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,859
This is where you'll find
the man you seek.

10
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:25,473
Here, I leave you.

11
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:36,596
- Thank you for bringing me.
- Any man in Braavos would have done the same.

12
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,187
- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.

13
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,476
Hello.

14
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:24,949
Valar morghulis.

15
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,380
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

16
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:45,050
- No one here by that name.
- Please!

17
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,560
I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

18
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,318
- You have everywhere else to go.
- But wait!

19
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:16,598
Cersei...Walder Frey...

20
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:21,952
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

21
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:28,569
Cersei...Walder Frey...

22
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:33,848
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

23
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:35,360
Cersei...

24
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,036
Walder Frey...

25
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,732
The Mountain...

26
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:40,924
Meryn Trant.

27
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:44,214
Cersei...

28
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,652
Walder Frey...

29
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:47,336
The Mountain...

30
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,157
Meryn Trant.

31
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,463
Cersei...

32
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,245
Walder Frey...

33
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:57,802
The Mountain...

34
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:01,115
Meryn Trant...

35
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,775
Must be good food if it's crowded.

36
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,589
Ale?

37
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,930
Ale?

38
00:08:56,728 --> 00:08:59,869
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven's scroll.

39
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:05,103
You are becoming an observant young lady.

40
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,886
My mother used to say "dark wings dark words".

41
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,765
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

42
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:16,143
So it's good news.

43
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,618
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

44
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,425
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

45
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:24,566
- Ale?
- I'll have some.

46
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,694
My Lady...

47
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:33,968
- What is it?
- Sansa Stark. Don't look!

48
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:36,354
You sure?

49
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:37,930
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

50
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,657
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

51
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:40,695
Littlefinger?

52
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,307
A bunch of knights with them.

53
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,540
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?

54
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,049
Ten, I think. Too many.

55
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:48,097
My Lady, I don't think this is...

56
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,470
Ready the horses!

57
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,108
We only have one horse.

58
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,542
Find more!

59
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,016
Do you like the taste?

60
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,735
Don't see what all the fuss is about.

61
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,792
Why do men love it so much?

62
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,862
It gives some men courage.

63
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,832
Does it give you courage?

64
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,836
That's far enough.

65
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,167
Lord Baelish.

66
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,926
Lady Sansa.

67
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:21,163
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

68
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:23,683
We've met, with Renly Baratheon.

69
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,991
What did he say about you?

70
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,712
He said,

71
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,642
Your loyalty came free of charge.

72
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:35,746
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

73
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,732
Lady Sansa.

74
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:53,564
Before your mother's death,

75
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,759
I was her sworn sword.

76
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:59,389
I gave my word I will
find you and protect you.

77
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,073
I will shield your back

78
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,389
and keep your counsel,

79
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,096
and give my life for you if needs be.

80
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,345
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

81
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,583
Please, Lady Brienne.

82
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,616
No need for such formality.

83
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,261
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.

84
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,194
- I was.
- Strange.

85
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:21,295
I knew Cat since the time we were children.
She never mentioned you.

86
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,792
It was after Renly's murder.

87
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:25,114
Ah, yes.

88
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:27,008
You were accused of killing him.

89
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:28,430
I tried to save him.

90
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,521
- But you were accused.
- By men who did not see what happened.

91
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,893
And what did happen?

92
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,780
He was murdered by a shadow.

93
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,939
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

94
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,262
A shadow?

95
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,231
With a face?

96
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,995
This woman swore to protect Renly,

97
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:54,310
she failed.

98
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,957
She swore to protect your mother,

99
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:57,878
she failed.

100
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,963
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

101
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,961
Why should you have any
say in her affairs?

102
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,445
Because I am her uncle.

103
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:09,050
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

104
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:12,134
We're family now. And you are an outsider.

105
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:13,325
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.

106
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,372
But experience has made
me wary of outsiders.

107
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:17,857
Lady Sansa...

108
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:20,127
- if we can have a word alone...
- No.

109
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:23,805
- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...
- I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...

110
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,108
bowing to the king.

111
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,066
Neither of us wanted to be there.

112
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:31,700
- Sometimes we don't have a choice.
- And sometimes we do.

113
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:34,943
You should leave.

114
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,284
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

115
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:41,055
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

116
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,914
Why don't you stay?

117
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,075
I'm gonna ask you to stay.

118
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,590
Stop! Stop! After him!

119
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,234
Podrick!

120
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,672
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

121
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:27,469
Stop!

122
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,069
That's a good boy. Come on.

123
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:33,266
Come on!

124
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,108
No, no, no, stop!

125
00:14:57,444 --> 00:14:58,941
Guess that means you're unarmed.

126
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:01,760
Don't! Put that down!

127
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,433
Podrick?

128
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:24,466
Yes, my Lady?

129
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,437
You can stand now.

130
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:28,036
Yes, my Lady.

131
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,636
Sansa Stark?

132
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,892
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

133
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,774
I saw her riding on the
Eastroad with Littlefinger.

134
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:41,932
- We'll follow them.
- My Lady...

135
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,863
if both Stark girls refused your service,

136
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,146
maybe you're released from your vow.

137
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,607
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

138
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,007
They don't want your protection.

139
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,598
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?

140
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,493
No, my Lady.

141
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,227
Get your horse.

142
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,600
A summons from the Queen.

143
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,273
There are only two like it in the world.

144
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,878
The one I'm wearing and the
one I gave to Myrcella.

145
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,329
It's a threat.

146
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,038
Of course it's a threat.

147
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:42,076
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded
by people who hate our family.

148
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,311
It's a threat,

149
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:47,725
No note?

150
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,672
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister.

151
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,572
And every other tragedy that

152
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,275
has befallen their accursed country.

153
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:56,820
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

154
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,768
Softer.

155
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:58,601
What?

156
00:16:58,721 --> 00:16:59,649
Not so loud.

157
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,868
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried
I am speaking too loudly?

158
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,861
No one can know she's our daughter.

159
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,497
Then don't call her your daughter.

160
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,483
You've never been a father to her.

161
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:13,102
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the streets.

162
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:14,624
And what has your caution brought?

163
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,933
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding,

164
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,827
our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,

165
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,333
our baby boy set to marry that
smirking whore from Highgarden!

166
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:37,741
I'm gonna make things better.

167
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:39,222
You've never made anything better.

168
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,488
I'm going to Dorne.

169
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,585
And I'm bringing our daughter home.

170
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,150
You can't just ask Prince
Doran to give her back.

171
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:49,426
She's promised to his son.

172
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:51,335
I'm not going to ask him anything.

173
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,285
You go down there with an army
it's an act of war.

174
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,258
No army.

175
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,615
Do you know where they're keeping her?

176
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,141
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

177
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,501
I'll find her.

178
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,334
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

179
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,255
You're going to Dorne.

180
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:17,261
A one-handed man.

181
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:19,269
Alone.

182
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,131
Who said I was going alone?

183
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,798
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

184
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,230
Roses are very nice,
definitely roses.

185
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,062
And music. I adore music.

186
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,384
But no flutes.

187
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,315
I hate flutes. We can have a harp,
if you like, but no flutes.

188
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:42,315
Then there's the food.

189
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,568
The food is the most important thing,
don't you agree?

190
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,277
We're gonna need pigeon pies.

191
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,875
That's what they eat in the capital,
don't they?

192
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,282
Don't they?

193
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:53,945
Don't who?

194
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:57,444
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

195
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,889
They certainly do, my dear.

196
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,491
They certainly do.

197
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:04,286
It's a fine place, isn't it?

198
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,612
A fine place.

199
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:10,797
I never thought I'd end up settling down
in a place like this.

200
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,406
You won't.

201
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:14,732
Pardon?

202
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,853
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

203
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,915
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

204
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,911
She hates me.

205
00:19:22,031 --> 00:19:23,511
She calls me mean names and sometimes

206
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:26,364
even still she pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.

207
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,841
You know what I think?

208
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:32,286
I think you're a good person.

209
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,080
And your sister is a mean person.

210
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,091
She is.

211
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,995
I've been all over the world

212
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,009
and if there's one thing I've learned,

213
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,541
is that meanness comes around.

214
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,023
People like your sister,

215
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,222
they always get what's coming for them,
eventually.

216
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:52,705
One way or another.

217
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,339
Who's that?

218
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,347
Jaime fucking Lannister.

219
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:05,597
Ser Jaime?

220
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:06,994
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

221
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,908
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

222
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:12,112
Thank you.

223
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,392
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

224
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:18,454
A pleasure.

225
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,546
Run along, love.

226
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,493
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

227
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:33,844
When are you planning on getting married?

228
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:34,936
Just get on with it.

229
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:36,121
On with what?

230
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:37,380
What you're here for.

231
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:40,981
There's no way this little visit
could possibly mean anything good for me.

232
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,229
It's very good for you.

233
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,394
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.

234
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:58,731
Mmm.

235
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,337
We've made a deal, your sister and I.

236
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
I would have advised against that.

237
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,578
How is this good for me?

238
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,618
Because you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

239
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:09,158
And when we return...

240
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:13,008
I'm gonna give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

241
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,515
Return from where?

242
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,436
As far south as south goes.

243
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,710
<i>You are my queen.</i>

244
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:57,708
The prince does not
wish to be disturbed.

245
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:59,343
Remove yourself from my path

246
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:01,413
or I'll take that long axe
and I'll shove it up your...

247
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:02,537
<i>Captain...</i>

248
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:05,783
let her pass.

249
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,809
Your brother was murdered...

250
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,690
and you sit here
in the Water Gardens

251
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:17,025
staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

252
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,595
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat

253
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:21,308
by law, that is no murder.

254
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,934
- Your brother...
- You don't have to remind me.

255
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,175
He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.

256
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:28,757
What will you know about his death?

257
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,480
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

258
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:32,530
And then?

259
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:33,843
You would have me go to war.

260
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:35,588
The whole country
would have you go to war.

261
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:38,764
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

262
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,765
The Sand Snakes are with me.

263
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,384
They have the love of their people.

264
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:45,637
They will avenge their father

265
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,608
while you sit here
in your chair doing nothing.

266
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:55,637
Oberyn is dead.

267
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:59,423
And this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens

268
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,748
eating our food,
breathing our air.

269
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:05,309
How many of your
brothers and sisters

270
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,995
do they have to kill?

271
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:09,488
<i>Let me have her.</i>

272
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:15,518
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

273
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,906
I loved my brother.

274
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,176
And you made him very happy.

275
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:24,093
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

276
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:29,790
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

277
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,409
Not here.

278
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,444
Not while I rule.

279
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,237
And how long would that be?

280
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,756
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

281
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:57,486
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.

282
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:00,129
'Course you haven't found any
Sons of the Harpy.

283
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,054
You haven't, have you?

284
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:06,657
My Second Sons
on the other hand...

285
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:11,588
they drink, they whore,
fight in streets,

286
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,334
they blend in.

287
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,669
They overhear things in taverns.

288
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:19,252
Follow people from the taverns
to nice quiet alleys.

289
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:23,758
Break a few fingers,
overhear a few more things...

290
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,481
before you know it...

291
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,728
No one here.

292
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:49,826
We go.

293
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,629
In a hurry?

294
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:52,606
You're afraid?

295
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:55,089
Unsullied fear nothing.

296
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,275
Right.

297
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,787
That's your problem.

298
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:03,085
You understood fear once, long ago,
but you forgot what it means.

299
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:05,941
Someone who's forgotten fear...

300
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,430
has forgotten how to hide.

301
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,180
Fear is useful that way.

302
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,135
Sons of the Harpy...

303
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,457
they want to put a collar
back on my neck.

304
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:49,892
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace...

305
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:52,327
- <i>you must kill him.</i>
- It would send a message.

306
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:54,462
I think you should
exercise restraint...

307
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:55,640
- <i>Your Grace.</i>
- Why?

308
00:25:55,642 --> 00:25:57,762
Well, for one thing, he
may have valuable information.

309
00:25:57,784 --> 00:26:00,952
Well, the Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

310
00:26:00,987 --> 00:26:02,128
How do you know that?

311
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:03,866
Because I questioned him.

312
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:06,861
And the information you did get...
he is young and..

313
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,000
He is born free.

314
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,214
Why should he want
to bring back slavery?

315
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:10,285
What did it do for him?

316
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,785
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

317
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,641
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

318
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:15,009
<i>They pay him.</i>

319
00:26:15,044 --> 00:26:17,244
Great families, afraid to do a thing.

320
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,534
They pay poor men
to do it for them.

321
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:19,647
And how do you know this?

322
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:21,382
- <i>Everyone know this.</i>
- I don't know it.

323
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:22,584
<i>And I'm the head of a great family.</i>

324
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,153
<i>We do not know what
this man did or didn't do.</i>

325
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:27,388
Give him a trial at least.

326
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:28,909
A fair trial.

327
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:30,895
Show all the citizens of Meereen

328
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,454
that you are better than those
who would depose you.

329
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:34,881
Teach them a better way.

330
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:37,477
I do not know the place
from where old ser comes.

331
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,323
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

332
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:43,995
But here, in Meereen,
before Daenerys Stormborn

333
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,562
they own us.

334
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:47,801
So we learn much about them...

335
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,981
or we do not live long.

336
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:52,337
They teach me what they are.

337
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:55,013
Mercy, fair trial...

338
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,048
these mean nothing to them.

339
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,083
All they understand is blood.

340
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:05,922
Thank you all for your counsel.

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,940
<i>Your Grace...</i>

342
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:17,575
a word, please, I beg you.

343
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,634
About what?

344
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,297
About your father.

345
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,332
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

346
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:23,999
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

347
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,261
Consider me reminded.

348
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:27,195
Your Grace...

349
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,026
I served in his Kingsguard.

350
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:31,752
I was at his side
from the first.

351
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,987
Your enemies did not lie.

352
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:36,827
Go on.

353
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:41,658
When the people rose
in revolt against him

354
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,189
your father set their towns and castles aflame.

355
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:47,775
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

356
00:27:48,604 --> 00:27:50,884
He burned men alive
with wildfire

357
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,819
and laughed as they screamed,

358
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:56,306
and his efforts to stamp out dissent

359
00:27:57,524 --> 00:28:00,076
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen...

360
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:01,957
except two.

361
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:04,567
I'm not my father.

362
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:07,140
No, Your Grace, thank the gods.

363
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:12,266
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

364
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:15,181
And each time,
it made him feel powerful...

365
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:16,490
and right...

366
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:18,849
until the very end.

367
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:27,279
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

368
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:32,570
Your Grace.

369
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:43,835
There's a bug.

370
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,344
Yes, best be careful.

371
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:48,168
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

372
00:28:48,203 --> 00:28:52,897
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

373
00:28:57,206 --> 00:29:02,473
Besides, what else is there for me
to do inside this fucking box?

374
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,408
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

375
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,612
You can't.

376
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:08,844
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

377
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:11,279
She ought to offer her cunt.

378
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,614
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

379
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:17,564
Well, I suppose a box is as good
a place for me as anywhere.

380
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,892
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

381
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,027
talking about the
futility of everything.

382
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,957
You're right, there's no point.

383
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,433
The road to Volantis?

384
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:30,343
You said we are going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

385
00:29:30,378 --> 00:29:31,754
The road to Meereen.

386
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:35,573
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

387
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,608
I told you.
A ruler.

388
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,843
But you've already got a ruler.

389
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,533
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

390
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:45,108
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

391
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:47,243
has someone's banner
hanging from it.

392
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:49,065
You are quite good, do you know?

393
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:51,018
At ruling.

394
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,808
During your brief tenure as Hand.

395
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:55,743
I didn't rule, I was a servant.

396
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:58,295
Still, a man of talent.

397
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,901
Managed to kill a lot of people?

398
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,083
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

399
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,499
She wanted me
to leave King's Landing.

400
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,641
She begged me.

401
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:13,821
I wouldn't go.

402
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,011
Why?

403
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,521
'Cause I liked it.

404
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:19,615
Power...

405
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,116
even as a servant.

406
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,606
People follow leaders

407
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,354
and they will never follow us.

408
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,389
They find us repulsive.

409
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:29,654
I find us repulsive.

410
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:32,060
And we find them...
repulsive, which is why

411
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:34,953
we surround ourselves
with large comfortable boxes

412
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,432
to keep them away.

413
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:38,487
And yet...

414
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:40,929
no matter what we do...

415
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:46,034
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

416
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:47,353
Not for long.

417
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:49,986
You're right.

418
00:30:50,756 --> 00:30:53,059
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

419
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:55,633
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

420
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:58,287
Is Cersei
going to kill them all?

421
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,758
Not him.

422
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:07,093
You're trying
to deceive your queen?

423
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:09,228
Should I throw them
in a cell, Your Grace?

424
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:10,903
It won't be necessary,
Ser Meryn.

425
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:13,384
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

426
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:15,582
Mistakes will be made.

427
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:16,381
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thanks.

428
00:31:16,383 --> 00:31:17,237
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

429
00:31:17,272 --> 00:31:18,232
Take the head.

430
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:19,139
Let me, Your Grace.

431
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:21,174
I would take it
if you don't mind.

432
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,209
It could prove
useful for my work.

433
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:25,644
Very good.

434
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:30,343
Over there would be fine.

435
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:33,888
You heard the man, over there.

436
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:03,602
You're the hand of the King.

437
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:05,090
No, uncle.

438
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,595
Clearly, it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

439
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:13,042
I'm merely advising my son until he comes
of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

440
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:17,149
Your Grace, I would be willing
to serve provisionally as the King's Hand

441
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,813
- until he becomes full...
- You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

442
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:22,048
but I don't imagine
we'll have the time.

443
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:24,298
In addition to be Master of Ships,

444
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:27,249
the King has appointed
you Master of Coin.

445
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:29,508
Oh, Your Grace.

446
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:33,615
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

447
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:38,074
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the Crown's interest in the same.

448
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:40,209
The honor is all mine,
Your Grace.

449
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:43,411
<i>Y-Y-Your Grace,
in the past, on several occasions,</i>

450
00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:46,103
a Grand Maester has
served as the King's Hand.

451
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:50,602
The King's named Qyburn
the new Master of Whispers.

452
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:54,033
Your Grace,

453
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:58,433
this-this man?
Th-This embarassment to the Citadel?

454
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,068
Your Grace...

455
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:03,983
what qualifications can he
possibly have for this post?

456
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:06,599
The qualification of loyalty,
Grand Maester.

457
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,734
That's far more than
the eunuch ever had.

458
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,324
Far more than many ever have.

459
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:13,875
I must say...
I can not...

460
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,149
Uncle Kevan,

461
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:18,425
in light of your position as
Commander of the Lannister Armies,

462
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,862
it would please the King if you
would serve as his Master of War.

463
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,808
No man living
better deserves the title.

464
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:26,907
That is kind of you to say.

465
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,814
I would like to hear it
from the King himself.

466
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:31,414
Well, the King is very
busy at this moment.

467
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,983
He should be here,
learning what it means to rule.

468
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:35,487
He is learning.

469
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:37,639
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

470
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:39,674
he's asked me
to speak on his behalf.

471
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:44,117
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother,

472
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:45,231
and to you,

473
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:47,022
and to serve the King.

474
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:50,577
I did not return to the capital
to serve as your puppet.

475
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,118
To watch you stack the
Small Council with sycophants.

476
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:56,637
Sending your own brother away...

477
00:33:56,672 --> 00:34:00,618
My brother has left the capital
to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

478
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:01,687
<i>What mission?</i>

479
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:04,046
That is not your concern
as Master of War.

480
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:08,672
I do not recognize
your authority to dictate

481
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:11,210
what is and is not my concern.

482
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,245
You are the Queen Mother.

483
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,531
Nothing more.

484
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:21,492
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

485
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:24,863
If he wants to send for me,
I'll be waiting for him.

486
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,998
At Casterly Rock.

487
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,540
Come on, you know this one.

488
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:39,683
It looks like an animal.

489
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,162
Snake.

490
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:47,083
S-S-Sn...
"S".

491
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,512
- It's an "S".
- <i>Right, very good.</i>

492
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,223
Hmm, did you know

493
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,978
that the youngest
Lord Commander in history,

494
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:56,530
Osric Stark,
was elected at the age of 10?

495
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:00,414
I know "S".

496
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,134
You'll learn, I promise.

497
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:02,878
I taught Ser Davos.

498
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,158
Old people are terrible
at learning new things.

499
00:35:05,193 --> 00:35:07,347
Well, you are a wonderful teacher.

500
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:10,077
Very patient.

501
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:13,019
I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing

502
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:14,119
<i>the faster you will
be able to read.</i>

503
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,567
That's all right.

504
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,221
We're doing just fine.

505
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:21,603
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

506
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,980
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

507
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:28,614
- <i>3.</i>
- 3?

508
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,148
Were you taught by your mother?

509
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:31,938
No.

510
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,873
Our Maester Cressen did.

511
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:37,342
I had a lot of time to practice.
My mother kept me inside because...

512
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,195
What do you call it in the south?
What happened to your face.

513
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,189
Grayscale.

514
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,104
What would you call it
in the north of the Wall?

515
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,184
I don't know.

516
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:54,254
But two of my sisters had it.
They both died.

517
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:55,990
How did they cure you?

518
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:58,610
I don't remember.
I was a baby.

519
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,047
A lot of people came and tried, I think.

520
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:03,385
Whatever they did, it went away.

521
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,827
What happened to your sisters?

522
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,224
My father made them move out
to the keep, outside.

523
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:15,847
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

524
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:20,239
But we heard them,
especially at night.

525
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:25,135
They started to sound
not like themselves.

526
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,139
Did you ever see them?

527
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:29,914
Only once, at the end.

528
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:33,250
They were covered with it.

529
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:39,736
Their faces, their arms,
they acted like animals.

530
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:43,955
My father had to drag them out
to the woods on a rope.

531
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:46,657
What did he do with
them in the woods?

532
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:53,436
Mother.

533
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:55,242
Leave us.

534
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,647
Your Grace.

535
00:37:01,465 --> 00:37:03,035
You need to stay
away from that girl.

536
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,588
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

537
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,869
Her name's Gilly.

538
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:07,704
She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

539
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,992
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

540
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:13,644
He executed their king
for treason.

541
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:16,915
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

542
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,621
Gilly wouldn't do that.

543
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:22,343
You have no idea
what people will do.

544
00:37:23,462 --> 00:37:25,674
All your books
and you still don't know.

545
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:34,467
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

546
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,802
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

547
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,337
You showed mercy
to Mance Rayder.

548
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:41,162
The King's word is law.

549
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:45,810
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

550
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:51,538
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

551
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:53,673
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

552
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:56,896
With respect, Your Grace,
the Free Folk will never follow you

553
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,236
no matter what you do.

554
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,411
You're the man
who burned their king alive.

555
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,246
Who then?

556
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,690
You?

557
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:09,915
No.
Only one of their own.

558
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:13,650
Do you know this wretched girl?

559
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,751
- Lyanna Mormont.
- Lord Commander's niece.

560
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:19,610
Lady of Bear Island.

561
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,567
And a child of ten.

562
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,016
I asked her to commit her house
to my court. That's her response.

563
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:29,445
Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

564
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,465
whose name is Stark.

565
00:38:31,814 --> 00:38:33,663
That amuses you.

566
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:37,005
I apologize, Your Grace.

567
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:41,644
Northerners commit
a bit like the Free Folk.

568
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,081
Loyal to their own.

569
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:45,612
I know.

570
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:48,814
My brother, Robert, went on often
and loudly about how difficult it was

571
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,345
to control them.

572
00:38:52,368 --> 00:38:54,365
Even with your father's help.

573
00:38:57,136 --> 00:39:00,343
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

574
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:02,956
Ser Alliser Thorne
is going to win.

575
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:05,010
- Most likely.
- One pleasant man.

576
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:07,004
He thinks you're a traitor.

577
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,706
What's your life gonna
be like here at the Wall,

578
00:39:09,741 --> 00:39:12,551
- with Thorne in command?
- Unpleasant, I expect.

579
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:14,388
Your bravery made him look weak.

580
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,308
He'll punish you for it.

581
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,518
I don't punish men for bravery.

582
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:21,047
I reward them.

583
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,182
I don't doubt that, Your Grace.

584
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,183
But I am a brother
of the Night's Watch.

585
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,133
I have pledged them my life,
my honor, my sword.

586
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,268
I don't know what
I have left to give you.

587
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,082
You can give me the North.

588
00:39:34,517 --> 00:39:35,635
I can't.

589
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:39,482
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard.

590
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:40,935
A Snow.

591
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,095
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword at my feet.

592
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,994
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

593
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,544
Lord of Winterfell.

594
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:56,731
He'll make you a Stark
with a stroke of a pen.

595
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,384
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

596
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,623
I daydreamed that my father
would ask the king.

597
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:06,056
Just like that I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

598
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:09,091
No, you deserve that.
You do.

599
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:11,285
I-I couldn't be happier for you.

600
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:13,848
I'm gonna refuse him.

601
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,120
But...

602
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:19,150
you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

603
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,951
I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

604
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:23,757
If I don't take
my own word seriously,

605
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,992
what sort of Lord of Winterfell
would that be?

606
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:30,688
<i>Hey.</i>

607
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,365
Crowded,
You'd think we were serving venison stew.

608
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:45,782
Does anyone wish to speak
for candidates...

609
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,491
before we cast our tokens...

610
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:54,991
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

611
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,198
Ser Alliser Thorne
is not just a knight,

612
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:01,085
he's a man of true nobility.

613
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,238
<i>He was Acting Commander
when the Wall came under attack</i>

614
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:05,773
and led us to victory
against the wildlings.

615
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:06,758
<i>Yes.</i>

616
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:08,247
He's a veteran of 100 battles

617
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:11,664
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

618
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:12,863
<i>Nice.</i>

619
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,316
- He's the only true choice.
- <i>Yes.</i>

620
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:17,264
<i>Yes.</i>

621
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:22,400
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

622
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:25,556
and has served loyally
longer than any other Ranger.

623
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:28,121
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Through ten winters he served.

624
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,082
As Commander of the Shadow Tower...

625
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:32,116
he kept the wildlings away.

626
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:33,851
We could do no better.

627
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:39,757
If there's no one else...

628
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:41,736
we will begin the voting.

629
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:46,686
The triangular tokens count
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

630
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:50,857
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

631
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:53,333
Maester Aemon...

632
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,157
Samwell Tarly, go on.

633
00:41:59,193 --> 00:42:00,652
Sam the Slayer.

634
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:05,286
Another wildling lover,
just like his friend, Jon Snow.

635
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:07,275
How's your lady love, Slayer?

636
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,670
Her name is Gilly.

637
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:12,040
Ser Slynt knows her quite well.

638
00:42:12,477 --> 00:42:15,118
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

639
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:16,799
Lies!

640
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:19,628
A wildling girl, a baby,

641
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:21,736
and Lord Janos.

642
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,412
I found him there after
the battle was over.

643
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:25,834
In a puddle of his own making.

644
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:34,596
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children

645
00:42:35,406 --> 00:42:36,754
Jon Snow was leading.

646
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:39,903
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,

647
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:42,218
but when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

648
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,860
He took charge of the Wall's defense,

649
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,955
he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,

650
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:49,854
he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.

651
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:52,924
Knowing it would almost certainly mean
his own death.

652
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:57,626
Before that,

653
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:02,499
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

654
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:06,598
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

655
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,357
He saw something in Jon.

656
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:10,327
And now we've all seen it too.

657
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:12,321
He may be young,

658
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:15,632
but he's the commander we turned to

659
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:17,428
when the night was darkest.

660
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:18,960
Yeah!

661
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,270
Aye.

662
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:28,528
Can't argue with any of that.

663
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,046
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

664
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:33,816
The Night's Watch?

665
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:36,910
Or the wildlings?

666
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,082
Everyone knows he loved
a wildling girl.

667
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,015
He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

668
00:43:43,135 --> 00:43:46,505
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

669
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:48,987
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

670
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:53,807
We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

671
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:57,222
Do you want to choose a man who has fought
the wildlings all his life

672
00:43:58,129 --> 00:44:00,300
or a man who makes love to them?

673
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:09,571
It is time!

674
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,981
Appears to be a tie, maester.

675
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:21,287
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

676
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:23,726
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

677
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,867
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

678
00:45:53,603 --> 00:45:56,039
You! You!

679
00:45:59,726 --> 00:46:00,920
What have you got there?

680
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:06,670
- I said...
- Turn around and go!

681
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,544
Turn around...

682
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:13,321
- and go!
- That's a nice little sword.

683
00:46:13,662 --> 00:46:15,855
Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.

684
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,460
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

685
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,820
Quickly, go! Go!

686
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:40,751
Who are you?

687
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:43,334
Why were they scared of you?

688
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:44,893
You lost this.

689
00:46:56,394 --> 00:46:58,368
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

690
00:46:58,709 --> 00:46:59,927
There isn't.

691
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:02,144
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

692
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,554
Who are you then?

693
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,015
No one.

694
00:47:09,405 --> 00:47:11,281
And that is who a girl must become.

695
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,557

696
00:48:02,906 --> 00:48:06,149

_

698
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:25,252
Why?

699
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,054
_

700
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:32,683

713
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,833

714

_

721
00:49:53,721 --> 00:49:55,475
_

722
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:07,127
Mhysa!

723
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:28,695
Mhysa!

724
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:30,941
Mhysa!

725
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,644
Mhysa! Mhysa!

726
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:38,295
She should have cut the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.

727
00:50:38,532 --> 00:50:40,478
That's what I keep telling
her to do to you.

728
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,549
Mhysa!

729
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,219

730
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:52,738

739
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:06,472
Mhysa!

740
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:44,369
Mhysa!

741
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,169
I'll stand guard outside
your door tonight, Your Grace.

742
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:52,036
We all guard tonight.

743
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:54,484
Leave me.

744
00:54:47,438 --> 00:54:49,154
Drogon!

745
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,882
Shh...
