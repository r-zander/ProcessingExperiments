1
00:00:01,236 --> 00:00:03,539
A royal wedding is history.

2
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:06,876
He's choking!

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:07,800
Joffrey!

4
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:09,305
- Come with me now.
<i>- Joffrey!</i>

5
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:11,514
He poisoned my son.

6
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:13,706
Take him.
Take him!

7
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,226
You're safe with me

8
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,552
and sailing home.

9
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:22,711
They say 1,000 slaves died

10
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:24,642
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

11
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,986
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,625
Do you know what that means?

13
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:38,715
It means I'll become king.

14
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:39,682
Yes.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,657
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

16
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,694
I demand

17
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,505
a trial by combat.

18
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:52,725
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

19
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:54,543
you are hereby
sentenced to death.

20
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,100
He came from the sky.

21
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,493
<i>My girl.</i>

22
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,161
My little girl.

23
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:07,961
Myrcella is my only daughter.

24
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,097
Dorne is the safest place
for her.

25
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,466
You're Arya Stark.

26
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:14,360
I'll take you to safety.

27
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,372
Arya!

28
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:20,064
Arya!

29
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,476
Ser Lancel, Cersei must have
great trust in you.

30
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:25,234
Get back to bed.

31
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,457
More wine, Your Grace?

32
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,349
A boar got me.

33
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:33,218
100 generations
have defended this castle.

34
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,609
She will not fall tonight.

35
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,541
Let's kill some crows!

36
00:03:54,181 --> 00:04:05,072

37
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,856
- We shouldn't be out here alone.
- Why not?

38
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:26,564
- If your father--
- He'll never know we're gone.

39
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,632
But if he finds out...

40
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:35,149
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

41
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,689
Are you sure?

42
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,481
Yes.

43
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:09,690
- We shouldn't go in.
- Of course we should.

44
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,148
Get out.
Get out!

45
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,106
- Let's go.
- No.

46
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,882
Listen to your friend.

47
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:03,939
They said that you
were terrifying

48
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,023
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

49
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,899
You're not terrifying.

50
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:13,398
You're boring.

51
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,500
You don't know what I am.

52
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,018
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

53
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,314
Tell me mine.

54
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,606
Everyone wants
to know their future

55
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,731
until they know their future.

56
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:30,106
This is my father's land.
My land.

57
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:35,151
Tell me my future or I'll have your two
boring eyes gouged out of your head.

58
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,398
Your blood.

59
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,940
Give me a taste.

60
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:16,221
Three questions you get.

61
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:19,232
You won't like the answers.

62
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,606
I've been promised
to the prince.

63
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:28,731
When will we marry?

64
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,407
You will never wed the prince.

65
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,398
You will wed the king.

66
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,856
But I will be queen?

67
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:36,273
Oh, yes.

68
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,606
You'll be queen.

69
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,481
For a time.

70
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:43,564
Then comes another,

71
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:45,064
younger,

72
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,689
<i>more beautiful,</i>

73
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,981
<i>to cast you down</i>
<i>and take all you hold dear.</i>

74
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:54,189
W-will the king and I
have children?

75
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,585
No. The king will have 20
children and you will have three.

76
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:00,689
That doesn't make sense.

77
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,148
Gold will be their crowns.

78
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,024
Gold their shrouds.

79
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:15,856
Come on, we have to go.

80
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,314
We have to go!
Cersei!

81
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:25,273
<i>Bearers, put it down.</i>

82
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,981
<i>Bearers, up.</i>

83
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,732
<i>Away.</i>

84
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,148
<i>Your Grace, we are</i>
<i>honored by your presence.</i>

85
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,564
<i>The mourners are waiting.</i>

86
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,079
They will keep waiting.

87
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,932
I want a moment alone with him.

88
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,391
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

89
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:12,557
day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

90
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,308
They will wait.

91
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,682
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

92
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,433
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

93
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:53,183
What he built, it's ours.

94
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:57,308
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

95
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,057
They're going to try
to take it away.

96
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,432
- All of it.
- They?

97
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,141
All of them out there,
our enemies.

98
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:06,932
They're waiting in line to make sure
he's really dead.

99
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,724
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

100
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,557
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

101
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:14,307
They have nothing to do with it.

102
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,599
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

103
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,932
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

104
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:19,974
You've been defending
him for years.

105
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,141
This is exactly what they want.

106
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:23,766
And now our father is dead

107
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:27,225
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

108
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,517
Did you set him free?

109
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,849
Tyrion may be a monster,

110
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,849
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

111
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,974
You killed him by mistake.

112
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,767
With stupidity.

113
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:46,682
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

114
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,224
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

115
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:52,225
Never mind the consequences.

116
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:56,891
Take a look.

117
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:57,892
Look at the consequences.

118
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:02,725
Here they are.

119
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,892
He loved you more than
anyone in this world.

120
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:43,975
Apologies.

121
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:57,349
I still don't see
why I had to stay

122
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,432
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

123
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:02,349
I saved your life.

124
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,099
If they catch you,
they catch me.

125
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,141
I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

126
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:09,224
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

127
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,932
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

128
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,599
through one of those airholes?

129
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,891
No, I only know what it's like

130
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:18,058
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

131
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,682
Pentos?

132
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,141
The home of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

133
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:28,516
a merchant.

134
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,474
He and I met many years ago

135
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:31,891
through mutual friends.

136
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:35,266
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

137
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:36,724
for the disaster he was.

138
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:39,766
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

139
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:43,307
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

140
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:45,932
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

141
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,557
that has led us both here.

142
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:52,016
Things have gotten worse,
not better.

143
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:55,100
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

144
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,724
Mmm.

145
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,182
Much better.

146
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:03,850
My lord?

147
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,724
I don't think I am anymore.

148
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,933
A lord.

149
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:20,725
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

150
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,766
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

151
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,724
for killing a whore.

152
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,641
It must happen all the time.

153
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:33,057
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

154
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:34,641
In a box.
Why stop now?

155
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:38,058
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

156
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,642
The future is shit.

157
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,725
Just like the past.

158
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,436
_

159
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:43,721
_

160
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,861
_

161
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:59,031
_

162
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,255
_

163
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:10,099
Shh.

164
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,808
Shh.

165
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,099
<i>The Sons of the Harpy?</i>

166
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,432
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

167
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,766
They've never killed before.

168
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,266
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

169
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:06,766
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

170
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,849
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

171
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,854
_

172
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:16,734
_

173
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,932
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

174
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,932
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

175
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,432
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

176
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,891
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

177
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,432
What was the name
of the man you lost?

178
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:32,891
White Rat, Your Grace.

179
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:37,057
I want him buried
with honor, publically

180
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,474
in the Temple of the Graces.

181
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,516
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

182
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:43,224
Make them very angry.

183
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:45,182
Angry snakes lash out.

184
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:47,891
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

185
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:51,308
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

186
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:56,353
Your Grace.

187
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,182
Torgo Nudho.

188
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,058
Missandei hin Naath.

189
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,642
I wanted to speak with you.

190
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,807
Why do you come?

191
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:31,767
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

192
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:37,267
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

193
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,432
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

194
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:44,100
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

195
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,600
May I ask you why?

196
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,683
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

197
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:59,183
I do not know.

198
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,725
<i>I must go.</i>

199
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:19,932
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

200
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,224
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

201
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,767
Now get it up.

202
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,932
Come.
Try it again.

203
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:42,057
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

204
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:44,516
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

205
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:47,307
Shouldn't you be training, too?

206
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:49,808
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

207
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,641
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

208
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:58,766
I might be the first in history.

209
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,682
<i>- Shield up.</i>
<i>- These men need a firm hand.</i>

210
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,432
Always have.

211
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,600
They're poachers and thieves.

212
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,183
Not soldiers.

213
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,767
That one hates me.

214
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:21,099
If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new Lord Commander...

215
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,766
He hates the wildlings.

216
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,557
All the wildlings.

217
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,141
- Don't let them send us away.
- <i> It's not a sure thing.</i>

218
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:31,682
Ser Denys Mallister has
commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years

219
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:33,516
and people say he's a good man.

220
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:34,641
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

221
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:37,266
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

222
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:38,516
I told you.

223
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:41,641
Wherever you go, I go, too.

224
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:43,933
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

225
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,893
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

226
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:56,642
Shield up.

227
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:01,100
The king wants a word.

228
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,724
You're not cold, my lady?

229
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,891
Never.

230
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:36,892
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

231
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:41,433
Feel.

232
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,517
Are you a virgin?

233
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:56,058
No.

234
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,517
Good.

235
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:08,682
Your Grace.

236
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,892
The bastard of Winterfell.

237
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:21,725
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

238
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:24,682
Roose Bolton.

239
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:27,975
Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

240
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,517
Don't you want to avenge him?

241
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,849
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

242
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,349
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

243
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,682
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

244
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:43,391
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

245
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:45,099
<i>Many don't.</i>

246
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,099
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

247
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,766
<i>Why?</i>

248
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,974
It's where she belonged.

249
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:54,391
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

250
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,349
too much affection
for the wildlings.

251
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,766
They were born on the
wrong side of the Wall.

252
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,807
That doesn't make them monsters.

253
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,099
No matter.

254
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,099
I shall take back the North

255
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,016
from the thieves who stole it.

256
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:07,599
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

257
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,182
I shall mount Roose Bolton's
head on a spike.

258
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,891
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

259
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:15,891
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

260
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:18,891
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

261
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,642
I'm talking about the wildlings.

262
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:32,766
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

263
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,766
to march in your army?

264
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,057
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

265
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,641
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

266
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:39,557
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

267
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:41,766
I'll give them land to live on.

268
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:45,932
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

269
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,891
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

270
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:50,932
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

271
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:52,054
I don't think that's likely.

272
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,307
You admire him, don't you?

273
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:59,057
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

274
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:00,974
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

275
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:02,308
...or he burns.

276
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:07,682
How much time do I have?

277
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:09,349
Nightfall.

278
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,641
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

279
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,307
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

280
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,516
<i>Shield up.</i>

281
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,349
<i> Attack, my lord!</i>

282
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,724
Attack!

283
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:26,349
Don't cross your feet.

284
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,099
My sons had swords
in their hands

285
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,724
from the time they could walk.
This one...

286
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:31,891
<i>Lord Arryn will never</i>
<i>be a great warrior.</i>

287
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,891
<i>Great warrior?</i>

288
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:36,516
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

289
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:39,432
My lord.

290
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,307
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

291
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,682
Some boys develop more slowly.

292
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,974
He's still young.

293
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:56,099
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

294
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,141
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

295
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,932
The gift of a great name.

296
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:04,682
Sometimes that's all one needs.

297
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:12,391
Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
for all you've done for me.

298
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:14,807
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

299
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:16,141
I have no doubt
that on my return,

300
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,099
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

301
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,266
He'll be safe here.

302
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:24,224
<i>As for his skills,</i>

303
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:26,433
I make no promises.

304
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:42,599
Will we head north
at some point?

305
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,891
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

306
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:47,516
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

307
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:50,600
- But that will take us--
- Us?

308
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,141
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

309
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:56,808
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

310
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:01,891
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

311
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,891
No one knows what you look like.

312
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:06,307
No one cares.
You're safe.

313
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,808
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

314
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,391
An attendant to a knight.

315
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:15,016
I'm not a knight.

316
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:17,266
That means you're not a squire.

317
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:18,349
Well, where would I go?

318
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,225
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

319
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:32,016
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

320
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,807
I found Arya. She didn't want
my protection.

321
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:37,017
- <i> Sansa still might.</i>
- Will you shut your mouth?

322
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,017
I didn't ask for your advice.

323
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,682
I don't want anyone
following me.

324
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:46,599
I'm not a leader.

325
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,599
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

326
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,517
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

327
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,766
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

328
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,974
I did.

329
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:11,099
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

330
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,058
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

331
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,349
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

332
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,724
but he's not alone
in that castle.

333
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:21,807
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

334
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:25,016
<i>stable boys and serving girls?</i>

335
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:27,974
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

336
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,432
No.

337
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:32,057
But I pay them well

338
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,349
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

339
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,724
So where are we going?

340
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:39,141
To a land where
you trust everyone?

341
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:41,891
To a land so far from here,

342
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:43,812
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

343
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:55,767
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

344
00:28:59,308 --> 00:29:00,474
Your father was a--

345
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:03,432
a force to be reckoned with.

346
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,641
He truly was.

347
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,807
I wouldn't presume to claim

348
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:10,141
to have known him
as such, but--

349
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:13,682
<i>but just being in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>

350
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:15,849
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

351
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,224
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

352
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:24,142
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

353
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,349
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

354
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,391
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

355
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:36,433
I often warned...

356
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:41,267
Your Grace.

357
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:46,516
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

358
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,807
My deepest sympathies.

359
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:51,932
I apologize
for my son's appearance.

360
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,054
Uncle, it's quite all right.

361
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:58,516
They call themselves sparrows.

362
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:01,224
Bloody fanatics.

363
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:03,224
Religion has its place,
of course,

364
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:06,057
but at a certain point...

365
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,016
They never would have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

366
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,682
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

367
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,682
whatever it is.

368
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:15,225
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

369
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:36,349
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

370
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,725
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

371
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,350
What can I do for you?

372
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,599
You can forgive me.

373
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,432
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

374
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,141
I led you into the darkness.

375
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,557
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

376
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,349
I tempted you into our...

377
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,600
unnatural relations.

378
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:04,600
And, of course,
there was the king...

379
00:31:06,183 --> 00:31:09,017
his boar hunt.

380
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,100
His wine.

381
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,641
I don't know what
you're talking about.

382
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,892
I'm a different person now.

383
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:25,432
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

384
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,099
<i>You can, too.</i>

385
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,724
<i>They watch over all of us,</i>

386
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:31,266
ready to dole out mercy

387
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:32,767
or justice.

388
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:38,517
Their world is at hand.

389
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,932
I will pray for
your father's soul.

390
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:49,100
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

391
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,391
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

392
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:03,307
It does.

393
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:07,433
That's the--
that's the Sunspear bit right there.

394
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:10,349
And that's where
the mountains are.

395
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,682
And over here is--

396
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,474
is Sunsnake?

397
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:17,099
Stonespear?

398
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,599
Sandstone.

399
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,182
Yes.

400
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:23,599
Yes, Sandstone.

401
00:32:25,017 --> 00:32:26,349
Just there.

402
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,350
Fine.

403
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:31,725
It's Dorne.

404
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:36,224
We should go there.

405
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:38,599
I think we would
have a lovely time,

406
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,974
judging by my experience.

407
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:45,724
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

408
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:47,267
Anywhere but here.

409
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,308
We're late for dinner as it is.

410
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,724
You're very respectful.

411
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm very hungry.

412
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:22,057
What's your name?

413
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,724
Olyvar, my lady.

414
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:25,557
I'm afraid my brother

415
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:29,017
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

416
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,725
My lady.

417
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:55,974
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

418
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,724
Why?

419
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,057
They all know about me anyway.

420
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:03,349
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

421
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,516
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

422
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:09,808
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

423
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:13,224
My intended?
Please.

424
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,641
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

425
00:34:14,642 --> 00:34:17,057
<i>That means no one</i>
<i>can force Cersei to marry me.</i>

426
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,266
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

427
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,724
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

428
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,807
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

429
00:34:24,808 --> 00:34:27,516
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

430
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:30,099
<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>

431
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,683
Perhaps.

432
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:35,766
Perhaps?

433
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,600
Perhaps.

434
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:54,182
Eunuch, the Spider, the
Master of Whisperers.

435
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:57,475
Imp, Half-man.

436
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,141
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

437
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,891
Not for a coward.

438
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:05,932
You are many things, my friend,

439
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,683
but not a coward.

440
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,016
You never told me
why you set me free.

441
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:17,016
Your brother asked me to.

442
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:18,266
Could have said no.

443
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:21,516
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

444
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:23,766
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

445
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,474
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

446
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:29,141
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

447
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:30,724
I didn't do it for you.

448
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:33,766
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

449
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:37,016
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

450
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:39,266
I don't believe in saviors.

451
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:42,642
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

452
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,057
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

453
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:50,141
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

454
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:53,349
You have many
admirable qualities,

455
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,724
self-pity is not
one of them.

456
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:57,016
Any fool with a bit of luck

457
00:35:57,017 --> 00:36:00,557
can find himself
born into power.

458
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,224
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

459
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:06,766
I'm not well-suited
for work.

460
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,391
I think you are.

461
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,474
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

462
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:12,057
And you have compassion.

463
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:15,266
Compassion? Yes.

464
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:17,891
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

465
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:21,682
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

466
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:23,724
I never said you were perfect.

467
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:27,682
What is it you want exactly?

468
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,682
Peace.

469
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:31,141
Prosperity.

470
00:36:31,142 --> 00:36:35,224
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

471
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:37,682
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

472
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:40,182
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

473
00:36:40,183 --> 00:36:42,474
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

474
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:44,891
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

475
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,807
Perhaps.

476
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:50,391
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

477
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:52,017
we assume there's no other way.

478
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,807
<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,</i>

479
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:57,974
<i>would you spread misery</i>
<i>throughout the land?</i>

480
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:00,391
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

481
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,807
<i>No, you won't.</i>

482
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:05,182
<i>But you could help another</i>
<i>climb those steps</i>

483
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:07,682
and take that seat.

484
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,724
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

485
00:37:10,725 --> 00:37:13,016
but gentler than Stannis.

486
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:15,932
A monarch who can intimidate the
high lords and inspire the people.

487
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:20,016
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

488
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:21,891
and the right family name.

489
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,182
Good luck finding him.

490
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:27,225
Who said anything about "him"?

491
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,557
You have a choice, my friend.

492
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,557
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

493
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:38,141
and drink yourself to death,

494
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,474
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

495
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:41,932
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

496
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,350
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

497
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,433
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

498
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:03,974
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

499
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:06,808
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

500
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:12,974
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

501
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:15,557
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

502
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:17,432
to a council of elders
made up of both

503
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,849
the freed men and
the former slaveholders.

504
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,974
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

505
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:23,724
Good.

506
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:26,266
They did ask
for some concessions.

507
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,016
Concessions?

508
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:31,099
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

509
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,016
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

510
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:37,266
<i> Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>

511
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:41,682
Still, it's easier to rule happy
subjects than angry ones.

512
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,682
I don't expect
the Wise Masters to be happy.

513
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:46,057
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

514
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:49,141
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

515
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:51,725
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

516
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:55,391
The fighting pits?

517
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:56,891
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

518
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:59,766
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

519
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,100
free men would fight free men.

520
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,016
<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>

521
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,099
<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>

522
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,432
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

523
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,641
No fighting pits.

524
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,974
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

525
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,932
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

526
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:17,349
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

527
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,600
If you-- - How many times must I say no
before you understand?

528
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:26,391
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

529
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,932
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

530
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,099
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

531
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,974
What?

532
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:35,600
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

533
00:39:37,683 --> 00:39:40,349
She liked to drink pear brandy.

534
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,432
The older she got, the less
she made selling her body,

535
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,807
the more she wanted to drink.

536
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:50,016
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

537
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:52,641
she fucked the night before.

538
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:54,932
I'm sorry.

539
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,682
Why?
I was a bad child.

540
00:39:57,683 --> 00:40:00,474
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

541
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:02,766
And I loved to fight.

542
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,766
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

543
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:06,932
who trained fighters
for the pits.

544
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,557
I had my first match
when I was 16.

545
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:11,724
You were sold into slavery,

546
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:14,182
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

547
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:15,682
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

548
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:20,182
I'm only here
because of those pits.

549
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:22,807
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

550
00:40:22,808 --> 00:40:24,224
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

551
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:26,849
Soon I was famous.

552
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,099
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

553
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,182
when I stepped into the pit.

554
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:31,682
I made so much money
for my master,

555
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:34,474
he set me free when he died.

556
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,266
I joined the Second Sons.

557
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,183
And then I met you.

558
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,016
You're the queen.

559
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:49,557
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

560
00:40:49,558 --> 00:40:52,141
Everyone but me.

561
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:56,349
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

562
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,141
As soon as they see weakness,

563
00:40:59,142 --> 00:41:01,391
they'll attack.

564
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,932
Show your strength here, now.

565
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:06,224
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

566
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:12,849
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

567
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,599
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

568
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
You're the Mother of Dragons.

569
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:29,308
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

570
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:33,182
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

571
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:35,642
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

572
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,725
I can't control them anymore.

573
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:47,682
A dragon queen with no dragons

574
00:41:47,683 --> 00:41:48,808
is not a queen.

575
00:42:55,225 --> 00:42:57,517
Viserion?

576
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:01,392
Rhaegal?

577
00:43:13,392 --> 00:43:14,932
Easy. Easy.

578
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,099
Easy.

579
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,724
So here we are.

580
00:43:58,725 --> 00:43:59,808
Here we are.

581
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,391
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

582
00:44:06,392 --> 00:44:08,600
And now, for our last meeting...

583
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:14,391
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

584
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:16,808
No, but it will be.

585
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,682
You know what Stannis wants?

586
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:24,224
He wants me to bend the knee.

587
00:44:24,225 --> 00:44:26,599
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

588
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,807
I'll give him this much,

589
00:44:29,808 --> 00:44:31,141
he's bold.

590
00:44:31,142 --> 00:44:32,682
Shouldn't a king be bold?

591
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,766
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

592
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:37,891
I respect him.

593
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:39,432
If he gets what he wants,

594
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:41,141
I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools

595
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:45,057
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

596
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:47,517
But I'll never serve him.

597
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,557
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

598
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:51,891
You told me your people
have bled enough.

599
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,516
That's right.

600
00:44:53,517 --> 00:44:56,807
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

601
00:44:56,808 --> 00:45:00,266
You spent your life convincing
90 clans to come together

602
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,349
for the first time in history.

603
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,516
Thenns and Hornfoots,

604
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:07,599
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

605
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,599
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

606
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,974
You didn't do it for glory.

607
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:16,141
You brought them
together to save them

608
00:45:16,142 --> 00:45:17,682
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>

609
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:19,557
<i>not if they're north</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

610
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:21,557
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

611
00:45:21,558 --> 00:45:23,392
Pride?

612
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:28,100
Fuck my pride.

613
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,683
This isn't about that.

614
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:36,808
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

615
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:42,932
They followed me
because they respected me.

616
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:44,891
Because they believed in me.

617
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:47,266
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

618
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:50,557
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

619
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:53,807
How many women?
How many children?

620
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:56,849
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

621
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,057
You're afraid of looking afraid.

622
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:01,892
Oh, I am afraid.

623
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:04,683
No shame in that.

624
00:46:14,058 --> 00:46:17,974
How will they do it?
Beheading?

625
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,850
Hanging?

626
00:46:22,558 --> 00:46:25,142
They'll burn you alive.

627
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:31,600
Bad way to go.

628
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:37,557
I'll be honest with you.

629
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:39,557
I don't want to die.

630
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:41,724
And burnt to death,

631
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,682
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

632
00:46:43,683 --> 00:46:45,557
scorched and screaming.

633
00:46:45,558 --> 00:46:48,349
But it's better than betraying

634
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,057
everything I believe.

635
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,516
And what happens to your people?

636
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:56,266
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

637
00:46:56,267 --> 00:46:58,682
and they'll sing
songs about you.

638
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,141
You'd rather burn than kneel.

639
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:01,808
The great hero.

640
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:07,516
Until winter comes and
the white walkers come for us all

641
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:10,183
and there's no one left to sing.

642
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,182
You're a good lad.

643
00:47:14,183 --> 00:47:17,349
Truly you are.

644
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:22,391
But if you can't understand why I won't
enlist my people

645
00:47:22,392 --> 00:47:25,141
in a foreigner's war,

646
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,142
there's no point explaining.

647
00:47:43,725 --> 00:47:45,724
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

648
00:47:47,558 --> 00:47:50,099
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

649
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,767
was all I ever wanted.

650
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:05,099
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

651
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,849
Westeros only has one king.

652
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,183
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

653
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:25,850
Kneel and live.

654
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:37,017
This was my home for many years.

655
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,349
I wish you good fortune

656
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,017
in the wars to come.

657
00:50:24,392 --> 00:50:27,432
We all must choose.

658
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:32,016
Man or woman, young or old,

659
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:35,432
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

660
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:38,932
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

661
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:41,974
<i>We choose good</i>
<i>or we choose evil.</i>

662
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:46,683
We choose the true god
or the false.

663
00:50:57,642 --> 00:50:59,557
Free folk,

664
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,974
<i>there is only one true king</i>

665
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,099
<i>and his name is Stannis.</i>

666
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,557
Here stands your king of lies.

667
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:10,683
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

668
00:53:00,212 --> 00:53:10,634
